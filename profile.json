Older versions, notably those for Minecraft 1.16.5, do not. This mod aims to fill that gap.\n\n#### Frequently Asked Questions ####\n\n**Q: Aren't there other mods that do this?**\n\n**A:** Yes and no. There are other mods similar to this which either add new items which act as a helmet and the Engineer's Goggles in one or simply let you put the Engineer's Goggles in a Curios head slot. Those mods either do not integrate with other mods (e.g. they only provide vanilla helmet + Engineer's Goggles combo items) or no longer work/are not being maintained.\n\n**Q: Which versions of Minecraft is this mod for?**\n\n**A:** 1.16.5 only.\n\n**Q: Which versions of Create is this mod for?**\n\n**A:** 0.3.2g only.\n\n**Q: Which versions of Curios is this mod for?**\n\n**A:** 4.1.0.0 or newer.\n\n**Q: Can you add feature X?**\n\n**A:** No. This mod has one purpose only and it already does that.\n\n**Q: How can I support you/your mods?**\n\n**A:** By using them! If you want to provide more direct support please consider using the PayPal link on this project page.\n\n**Q: Can I use this mod in modpacks?**\n\n**A:** Yes on the condition that you do not misrepresent the origin of this mod.","published":"2023-12-19T22:11:39.700738Z","updated":"2023-12-31T06:29:57.385730Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":386,"followers":5,"categories":["equipment","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["uZbgMzD0","GIrvmLGZ","BlLTatFu","rIPEZY84"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cmnVQIxL/eb8cd8adb245e28bfb6cf24f4ae6e3bea95a0ee6.png"},"version":{"id":"rIPEZY84","project_id":"cmnVQIxL","author_id":"9jGCJ1p0","featured":false,"name":"Create Curio Goggles v0.0.4","version_number":"0.0.4","changelog":"### Bug Fixes ###\n\n* Fixed invalid `mods.toml` file in JAR.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-31T06:29:58.664188Z","downloads":331,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"0ea79c191cccbcb40d0ee7e43eb273f9999b49b691f795c10ec17ffd32c8091fa326a447a0accdeb07001f048c433fa4319d3e1ebd9001523d9cbc7493439a27","sha1":"046aaa22bfcea7c6f7ca1295904be9472a946165"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cmnVQIxL/versions/rIPEZY84/creategogglescurio-1.16.5-0.0.4.jar","filename":"creategogglescurio-1.16.5-0.0.4.jar","primary":true,"size":23278,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"eeb72b4450e37ba6910d850cdb4c8594b8d456d6235887ca00cfa650315b6e8c70f53c995a52eb3282360040eb3eb83d758b13ae2162fdd421d2036ec7c571fa","sha1":"b31cfe02e95d3e86d8b97b7cc7123c74a95ab381"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cmnVQIxL/versions/rIPEZY84/creategogglescurio-1.16.5-0.0.4-javadoc.jar","filename":"creategogglescurio-1.16.5-0.0.4-javadoc.jar","primary":false,"size":20150,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"fd09e6f7dcc7954a0ea43b3037861d49155a9f98","sha512":"1c46977cda5ee946228dc6a8491c5ebefff931adccf301fe3a7ebba8ab9f31cd22918533798eb4eb166983b790c139eeed8cb2e506501a0d20536d25b02f39ac"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cmnVQIxL/versions/rIPEZY84/creategogglescurio-1.16.5-0.0.4-sources.jar","filename":"creategogglescurio-1.16.5-0.0.4-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":21460,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"vvuO3ImH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"LNytGWDc","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.16.5"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"yyo46QJA","user":{"id":"9jGCJ1p0","username":"glektarssza","name":"G'lek Tarssza","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94402525?v=4","bio":"Canadian programmer, gamer, and modder.

In the game directory, go into&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/Multiplayer_[server_address]/DIM-1/[map_folder]</em>. If such doesn't exist already, create a folder called \"<strong>caves</strong>\", without the quotation marks, and go into it. Inside the caves folder, create a folder called \"<strong>-2147483648</strong>\", without the quotation marks, if such doesn't exist already. Go back into the folder that contains the \"<strong>caves</strong>\" folder and move all \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files to the&nbsp;<strong><em>caves/-2147483648</em></strong>&nbsp;folder. Feel free to delete the cache folders or also move them with the \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files.</p>\n\n### How do I set up cave mode to behave like it used to pre 1.30 before cave mode was introduced?\n\n<p>You can fully achieve this only when using the normal version of the minimap or no minimap at all. The fair-play version of the minimap now disables world map cave mode in the Nether and you can't toggle that, so it won't be exactly like it used to be.</p>\n<p>If you have Nether map data from before 1.30, please start by moving it in the correct folder as explained under \"<em>How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?</em>\" on this page.<br />After you're done with that, join a world/server and open the world map settings. Locate \"Default Cave Mode Type\" and set it to OFF and then set \"Legible Cave Maps\" to ON. Next, open the world map screen and click the cave icon in the bottom left of the screen. In the menu that opens, set the \"Cave Mode Top Y\" to absolutely any number. If you are in the overworld, set the \"Cave Mode Type\" to OFF. When you are in the Nether later, set&nbsp;\"Cave Mode Type\" to Full. The cave mode type is stored per dimension, so you can set it to Full for any nether-like dimension and keep it on OFF for anything else. You can also switch between displaying below and above bedrock roof by toggling it.</p>\n\n### Why does right-click teleportation not work for me?\n\nThe mod sends a chat command to teleport you to specific coordinates, which is _/tp @s x y z_ by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla /tp command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the world map settings with \"Map Teleport Command\". Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. There is also an option called \"Player Teleport Command\" which is used when you right click tracked players (e.g. your party from Open Parties and Claims). Teleportation to waypoints uses its own setting in the minimap mod. You can read about it on the minimap description page under FAQ.\n\n### How do I discover the map without manually walking?\n\n<p>In singleplayer, the map is loaded directly from the world save. This means that you can pregenerate the world using whatever tools you prefer, relog and use the \"Reload Regions\" option in the world map settings to fix any conflicts in the map cache. In multiplayer, it isn't as simple. However, if you can download the server world save and enter the world in singleplayer, then you can pregenerate the world using a method of your choice, relog and then use the \"Convert All Regions\" in the world map settings to convert the whole world save to a multiplayer-compatible map instance saved to <i>XaeroWorldMap->World->null->cm$converted</i>. You can copy/move that map instance folder to your server map instances in the XaeroWorldMap folder.</p>\n\n### Why are multiple worlds on the same server address/IP using and writing to the same map?\n\n<p>This mod lets you have multiple maps on the same server address. You can freely switch between maps and create new ones at any time. Map overwriting can be prevented by choosing the right \"Map Selection\" mode for the type of server that you are playing on. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you don't have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why does the world map ask for confirmation?\n\n<p>A single server address can have multiple overworlds, nethers etc. It can be due to multiple sub-servers or just multiple world saves, for example a \"Lobby\" world and a \"Game\" world. Different worlds don't have any unique identifiers on the client side, which makes it impossible to reliably differentiate between them. Because of this, the world map mod lets you have multiple world maps for each dimension on the same server address. In older mod versions, by default, map selection is <em>Manual</em>, which means that you are asked to confirm which map to use every time you switch dimensions/worlds/sub-servers. You can also choose one of the 2 automatic modes. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">don't</span> have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why can't I see my minimap waypoints on a server after the installation of the world map?\n\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic. This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting <em>Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n\n### Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. Old world map versions use a world spawn-based system to separate a server into multiple maps. This system often breaks because of servers adding custom functionality to the vanilla compass item by sending fake world spawn coordinates to your game client.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Make sure you update the mod to the latest version.</strong>&nbsp;There are now multiple map selection modes you can choose between,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;being the default one. You can now view any world map you have on the current server address. Click the bottom left icon on the world map to open the map selection menu, if it's not open by default. <strong>The top center dropdown menu allows you to select existing or create new world maps.</strong> You can hover over the map selection mode setting (bottom left) to read about how each mode works. <em>Server </em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side.&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;mode is the safest alternative and should work on every other server. There are also 2 additional automatic map selection modes when <em>Server</em> mode isn't an option. Read more about them in the tooltip of the setting.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">Old map is not in the map menu?&nbsp;</em></strong></u>This can mean 2 things: the server address has changed or the dimension IDs have changed.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the&nbsp;<u><strong class=\"bbc\">dimension ID change</strong></u>. Each dimension on the server has a separate directory in the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you begin doing anything with it.</strong>&nbsp;In older mod versions, the dimension directory name contains the server address and the dimension key, for example&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1_DIM1</em>. In newer versions the dimension directory is a sub-directory, so something like&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/DIM1.</em> For compatibility reasons, default&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">overworld, nether and the end</em>&nbsp;dimensions are named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">null, DIM-1 and DIM1</em>. Other dimensions should have their name be based on the original dimension ID, for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/minecraft$overworld_creative</em>. In 1.16+, you can see your current dimension ID on the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">F3 screen ingame</em>&nbsp;to figure out which directory is meant for which dimension (for example \"minecraft:overworld\").&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Please exit to the game title screen or close the game before editing files/directories.</em><br />Each dimension directory contains sub-directories, one for each map that you have in the dimension (for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw$default</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw-4,0,-4</em>) as well as a file named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">dimension_config.txt&nbsp;</em>that contains the actual display names of the maps. You can use the file to help you find a specific map directory that you want. Moving/copying a map directory between dimension directories should move/copy it between dimensions. You can give it a name later ingame.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">The most common case would be&nbsp;</em></strong>something like moving a map from <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/null</em></strong>&nbsp;to <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/minecraft$overworld_survival</em></strong>. It is needed when a 1.16+ server starts using a unique dimension ID for each sub-world.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\">For server address changes</strong></u>, you would first have to remove all directories inside&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;that contain the new server address. There is usually only 1 such directory if you are using the latest mod version.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the whole&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you do that. Also, exit the game at least to the title screen.&nbsp;</strong>Then you would have to rename each old server address directory (in XaeroWorldMap) to the new address, replacing ONLY the address part.</p>\n<p>Message me or leave a comment if you have questions!</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Here's the old explanation if you can't update the mod to 1.6.1 or newer:</em></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted (this has never happened as far as I know). It's likely caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection. In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the map \"resetting\".<br />If the map \"reset\" because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your map (and hope the plugin doesn't do it again):</p>\n<p>Make sure Minecraft is&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">NOT RUNNING</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>1. Go to the game directory</p>\n<p>2. Go to the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory</p>\n<p>3. Find directories that represent the dimensions you have visited on the server. These directories contain the address of the server in their name. The one that ends with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>&nbsp;is the overworld,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_dim-1</em>&nbsp;is Nether etc.</p>\n<p>4. Open the overworld directory (<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>).</p>\n<p>5. You should see multiple directories that start with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>.</p>\n<p>6. Find the one that is the biggest in file size. Copy the name of it somewhere so you don't lose it.</p>\n<p>7. Now find the newest&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>&nbsp;directory (likely the emptiest or just check the creation date). Move this directory somewhere else.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Don't delete it just yet.</strong></p>\n<p>8. Rename the directory from step 6 to the name of the backed up directory from step 7.</p>\n<p>9. Open Minecraft and test if the overworld world map is back.</p>\n<p>10. If it's not, exit Minecraft and restore the old name of the directory that you have renamed + restore the backed up folder. Reread all the steps to make sure you're doing everything right.<br />If overworld is now fixed, proceed to step 11.</p>\n<p>11. Rename and backup the directories with the same names as overworld for every other dimension that you'd like to restore.</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n### Why have my waypoints not restored after restoring the map?\n\n<p>Please read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimap description</a>&nbsp;page. It should cover most cases. Contact me, if it doesn't help.</p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you have the minimap installed, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p>(requires minimap to work)&nbsp;<strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart. Do the same for the minimap mod.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

So basically it uses a BlockEntity to store the inventory, and it can be interacted with by \"automation\", meaning Hoppers, pipes etc.\n\nA couple of notable things:\n1) While it has the normal maximum stack sizes when used by a player, the maximum stack size for automation (inserting items by Hoppers etc.) is 1 item per crafting grid slot.\n2) The output slot is the first slot for automation, so pulling out items happens from the output slot first. So it's not necessary to filter for the output item type.\n\nThis makes it possible to automatically fill the grid for each recipe, then suck out the \"filler items\" that should be empty slots in the final recipe, and then suck out the crafting result items.\n\nThe mod was started by Xcom6000, and the idea was to demonstrate to Mojang how the vanilla Crafting Table could be enhanced, so that it would also work for automated crafting contraptions.\n","published":"2023-04-17T19:32:52.448690Z","updated":"2023-06-11T11:35:42.396471Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1031,"followers":0,"categories":["technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["ZQwCkQcL","ciN7VFQ9","Al8oi32k","EgPXYD0X","CSQm56nM","73ta1ga9","AAKUicYt","nPFpeHSi","kBo5K7w0","oZF8TO14","tWQWf70x","N4FD4ktT","9ZzFghZG","aYBigqtt","BSO4Ozyn","9bnUFoRb"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XasICU6E/2bd2b65b08b787b02544e61daf60c7c8ef0b5890.png"},"version":{"id":"N4FD4ktT","project_id":"XasICU6E","author_id":"yduuH4WA","featured":false,"name":"Low Tech Crafting 0.2.0","version_number":"0.2.0","changelog":"- Update to MC 1.16.3\n\n**Original build time:** 2020-10-14 01:17:11 UTC+3","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-11T11:22:38.847597Z","downloads":701,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"fd6c9c796a5665b1321c721471005eca4b268526dbb91d5a783c82ad5e624c948e396a4e9794decc7facddac1a56a5694ccecc26da385d304b2f19c8dab7e518","sha1":"25373d9e7a5b684c2d4e171b4ddbfee62c493d54"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XasICU6E/versions/N4FD4ktT/lowtechcrafting-1.16.3-0.2.0.jar","filename":"lowtechcrafting-1.16.3-0.2.0.jar","primary":true,"size":85172,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"e1i1Oc8r","user":{"id":"yduuH4WA","username":"masa","name":"Matti Ruohonen","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2331050?v=4","bio":"Some weird dude working on a number of Minecraft mods at times.","created":"2022-11-13T10:34:18.079216Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"lowtechcrafting-1.16.3-0.2.0.jar"},"mods\\VisualWorkbench-v1.1.0-1.16.5.jar":{"sha512":"5b17e68296429ac47e6081f6652dc83f726de26cc5f714867c8b273a430019c2ac93a8542f8381706e1082cd6b91533b4cf99defc5682826dae9266b01325395","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Visual Workbench","description":"Items stay inside of crafting tables and are also rendered on top.

The viewer can also apply deobfuscation mappings.\n\nIt works by sampling statistical data about the systems activity, and constructing a call graph based on this data. The call graph is then displayed in an online viewer for further analysis by the user.\n\nThere are two different profiler engines:\n* Native `AsyncGetCallTrace` + `perf_events` - uses [async-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler) (*only available on Linux x86_64 systems*)\n* Built-in Java `ThreadMXBean` - an improved version of the popular [WarmRoast profiler](https://github.com/sk89q/WarmRoast) by sk89q.\n\n### ⚡ Memory Inspection\n\nspark includes a number of tools which are useful for diagnosing memory issues with a server.\n\n* **Heap Summary** - take & analyse a basic snapshot of the servers memory\n  * A simple view of the JVM's heap, see memory usage and instance counts for each class\n  * Not intended to be a full replacement of proper memory analysis tools. (see below)\n* **Heap Dump** - take a full (HPROF) snapshot of the servers memory\n  * Dumps (& optionally compresses) a full snapshot of JVM's heap.\n  * This snapshot can then be inspected using conventional analysis tools.\n* **GC Monitoring** - monitor garbage collection activity on the server\n  * Allows the user to relate GC activity to game server hangs, and easily see how long they are taking & how much memory is being free'd.\n  * Observe frequency/duration of young/old generation garbage collections to inform which GC tuning flags to use\n\n### ⚡ Server Health Reporting\n\nspark can report a number of metrics summarising the servers overall health.\n\nThese metrics include:\n\n* **TPS** - ticks per second, to a more accurate degree indicated by the /tps command\n* **Tick Durations** - how long each tick is taking (min, max and average)\n* **CPU Usage** - how much of the CPU is being used by the server process, and by the overall system\n* **Memory Usage** - how much memory is being used by the process\n* **Disk Usage** - how much disk space is free/being used by the system\n\nAs well as providing tick rate averages, spark can also **monitor individual ticks** - sending a report whenever a single tick's duration exceeds a certain threshold. This can be used to identify trends and the nature of performance issues, relative to other system or game events.\n\n## Usage\nTo install, just add the **.jar** file to your mods directory.\n\nInformation about [how to use commands](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/Command-Usage) can be found in the docs.\n\nIf you’d like help analysing a profiling report, or just want to chat, feel free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/PAGT2fu).\n\n\n## Guides\nThere are a few small \"guides\" available in the docs, covering the following topics.\n* [The tick loop](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/The-tick-loop)\n* [Finding the cause of lag spikes](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/Finding-lag-spikes)","published":"2021-06-04T13:36:54.735179Z","updated":"2023-12-11T22:48:54.192826Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":663776,"followers":769,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["JdNt7oGW","liwd7pvc","D6L5yWtJ","huGeKmwp","sf2nOVoP","DhT8Y7bB","b3zKGLTS","yysWZODg","eEAJpQea","VkKsarbC","qBdtA5uj","6BEDTXhR","9NSIbttL","JjikdHMk","sYlxF6IX","CWiQ0oM4","xvqXC3WU","X9SnVAPS","jg0K11We","Biivc7P1","g60nhl1v","LVujS26K","6hatB19T","FnKxsd40","mMSAkTm6","3opVno4q","EWTsXhFU","RhyaY2vw","XXMFHMBO","OT1CD9Qj","E5XaSI1N","1K3xO8TS","23U6xkbl","g5rM8xSA","pjW9S4dI","N7JzEApO","1dlOe6ez","XhFbpH8f","VhY9p1RU","GygIHGfW","qyMNf4Pn","oCK984FP","dVHkMOHv","Yp6s4wsw","BeIg1bik","4FXHDE9F","XGW2fviP","h0Z2ObM0","tCU9VuzX","8ZQqfeXy","3FEq2lT7","FeV5OquF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/l6YH9Als/13676ddae142a85998c1c0086cafc30ce2efde80.png"},"version":{"id":"9NSIbttL","project_id":"l6YH9Als","author_id":"iRtG8gdL","featured":false,"name":"1.9.1 (Forge 1.16.5)","version_number":"1.9.1-forge1165","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-04-24T16:48:28.373514Z","downloads":15791,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"599ed5064ad591d1cf4f93fc6fd4e0623fef69f1fa31df05b463edaf140888a0722c0cb93afe1c0ff6a183881b5f9c8e18a261f8b4f26624f50c9a0a2a750a54","sha1":"e535ad75bb2f541ea8c9ad3fda5da9b3241c2575"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/l6YH9Als/versions/1.9.1-forge1165/spark-1.9.1-forge.jar","filename":"spark-1.9.1-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":3157081,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"xI8OXSR4","user":{"id":"iRtG8gdL","username":"lucko","name":"lucko","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8352868?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-05T13:08:25.863305Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"spark-1.9.1-forge.jar"},"mods\\extractpoison_1.16.5-1.6.jar":{"sha512":"8db9beada745767830367fe72f01ac80a1f3ebdfe2be44e579d61ae15f105f5b2a944430d17148d7c8e7d7cbfae776c288c64928da7923d086c204f9c6196033","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"S4eFpJFD","slug":"extract-poison","project_type":"mod","team":"Bx1NFhBB","title":"Extract Poison","description":"🐍 Extract poison from cave spiders, pufferfish and bees with an empty glass bottle.","body":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><center><a href=\"https://serilum.com/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/description/header/header.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"838\" height=\"400\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://curseforge.com/members/serilum/projects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/curseforge.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/user/Serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/modrinth.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://patreon.com/serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/patreon.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://youtube.com/@serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/youtube.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a></center></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Requires the library mod&nbsp;<a style=\"font-size:24px\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/collective\" rel=\"nofollow\">Collective</a>.</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;<br><br> &nbsp;

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

Tweaks","description":"Enhances inventory management by adding various functions to the mouse buttons. ","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2024-03-04T10:40:46.719822Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":979363,"followers":1511,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader","neoforge"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR","LABx1dmK"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"RNWLd5dh","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.16.2+] Mouse Tweaks 2.14","version_number":"1.16.2-2.14","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.901223Z","downloads":19617,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"5f2366c650c102c71e98c9445f86a266ba20e1e4","sha512":"141b6988224f81f485e257d007a4632f50c5c6102742e0ba9f2e5911c19d5b0eae60ddac12326ee14deca2103d8f98627bf5ae48b51e7e532fcd26d3d0b0815c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/2.14/MouseTweaks-2.14-mc1.16.2.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-2.14-mc1.16.2.jar","primary":true,"size":58249,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"570d6d140907a858f9799bc858234a5491b02076","sha512":"c238f09d0a24317522c70dd9ae2e4e521f32efa865d8fe8102e0376c8877d4fda7bf30c58590483a0b79d537edb83eac1bf7ba06bfabb9c1ee9f83b44792cfeb"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/2.14/MouseTweaks-2.14-mc1.16.2-api.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-2.14-mc1.16.2-api.jar","primary":false,"size":2478,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"d34a7e525ef2425081322d197642326aadbf4db725043eefcd103e7609e5b21cc16f98b7df1489795eedcb9ef7a928815975eabfad30cd65a08573ef167c5a9f","sha1":"626415b392b481f967ac5d9b87e2ed8d1ea0f996"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/2.14/MouseTweaks-2.14-mc1.16.2-src.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-2.14-mc1.16.2-src.jar","primary":false,"size":23433,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gn6mAc1d","user":{"id":"On32SQVu","username":"YaLTeR","name":"Ivan Molodetskikh","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794388?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-03-20T15:35:29.504966Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"MouseTweaks-2.14-mc1.16.2.jar"},"mods\\ageingcheckcache-1.16.5-0.0.2.jar":{"sha512":"cb587c630e4aa61107853c8fc39bbf8e9f8b0f8bea5fc1d5de43d9c5ee56f5d219cfc1d116ce5bb3e93ce402a901f97ff3ae2de6de0c81316fc328552b60105a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"lOA6jWUO","slug":"ageingcheckcache","project_type":"mod","team":"705FCcz9","title":"AgeingCheckCache","description":"Cache the iteration results of Ageing Spawner codes for better performance","body":"# AgeingCheckCache\nThis is an addon of [Ageing Spawner](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ageing-spawners) that optimizes its code by cache.\n### How Does It Work\n```\nI've noticed a point about List#contains (checking if a list contains a specific element). \nMany mod authors open up blacklists or whitelists in config files to achieve higher configurability. \nHowever, if the list contains too many elements (whether they are default configurations or user-added ones), iterating through List#contains calls can become quite expensive, affecting the game's performance in specific situations \n(Embeddium Extras significantly improved FPS after addressing this performance issue). The solution I've come up with is to transform it into checking the properties of the List#contains target, perform the check only once, and directly call the cached boolean value obtained from this initial check. \nThis avoids repeatedly traversing the array. \nThe initial check's location and method might vary depending on the properties of the check target. \nFor example, if the check target is EntityType, you could create an ExtendedEntityType interface, implement it using a mixin with EntityType, and include a boolean value for \"is included in the configuration file\" within the mixin. \nThen, in certain places (such as FMLCommonSetupEvent), you can directly use the configuration file's array to check all EntityType instances using ForgeRegistries and mark whether they are included in the array. \nIn practical applications, instead of using List#contains, you can use ((ExtendedEntityType)entityType).isInConfig() (check speed goes brrrrrrrrrr).\n```\n### Why Don't You Send A Pull Request To Ageing Spawner?\n1.I have created an issue for this (See [here](https://github.com/Mrbysco/AgeingSpawners/issues/5)) but the author just did the basic caching in 1.20 version, while this mod is for 1.16.5\n\n2.I'm lazy.\n\nBtw you can do this by yourself as this mod is in public domain.\n### Will Ageing Spawner's Behavior Change After Using This Mod?\nYes. \n\nInitially, Ageing Spawner will track all vanilla & modded spawners (like the Land Spawner in [BrassAmber BattleTowers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/brassamberbattletowers) (In short, babt)). This mod has an additional patch that defaultly blacklists the modded spawners. \n\nThis improves compatibility with babt so your tower's advancement will not be completely blocked due to the spawners disappear :)\n\nIf you want a modded spawner block to be affected by Ageing Spawner, you can write the block's registry name down in config/ageingcheckcache-common.toml\n### Logo Credit\nThanks to [reereeq](https://legacy.curseforge.com/members/reereeq)!\n### Misc\n[![image](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/75401fe6-76e7-471c-89e5-1edd37a950ad.webp)](https://bisecthosting.com/kasualix)","published":"2023-12-06T14:34:41.317534Z","updated":"2023-12-06T14:38:49.287003Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":149,"followers":0,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":["mobs"],"game_versions":["1.16.5"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["NMRwhZ8X"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lOA6jWUO/0f6278c98cbb7e28c245956686a6b40b07d26716.png"},"version":{"id":"NMRwhZ8X","project_id":"lOA6jWUO","author_id":"yoApeVOc","featured":false,"name":"AgeingCheckCache 1.16.5-0.0.2","version_number":"1.16.5-0.0.2","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-06T14:38:50.151998Z","downloads":149,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"6e86356d0b67f1be49e1d1588595052a7951ea20","sha512":"cb587c630e4aa61107853c8fc39bbf8e9f8b0f8bea5fc1d5de43d9c5ee56f5d219cfc1d116ce5bb3e93ce402a901f97ff3ae2de6de0c81316fc328552b60105a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lOA6jWUO/versions/NMRwhZ8X/ageingcheckcache-1.16.5-0.0.2.jar","filename":"ageingcheckcache-1.16.5-0.0.2.jar","primary":true,"size":11169,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"npA68nxC","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.16.5"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"705FCcz9","user":{"id":"yoApeVOc","username":"Kasualix","name":"Catastrophe Chou","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110756250?v=4","bio":"\nمكتوب\n","created":"2022-08-15T11:08:18.078827Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ageingcheckcache-1.16.5-0.0.2.jar"},"mods\\cavebiomeapi-1.16.5-1.4.2.jar":{"sha512":"91185fa59122cb21c1bd5d474222be2b82fb29f1245185795168049bd7dbd49a3fcca32930ad8be2fb79ece2190bf220bde28d6c56f059a7ffc25b9e44ce01b2","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"CaveBiomeAPI","description":"    This mod works as a tool that allows the creation and generation of Cave Biomes\n    ","authors":["BlackGear"],"version":"${file.jarVersion}","icon":"C:\\Users\\NukelordBrown\\AppData\\Roaming\\com.modrinth.theseus\\caches\\icons\\bffb861e318d1ae55522614c5380194f0ba2b5a2.png","project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"cavebiomeapi-1.16.5-1.4.2.jar"},"resourcepacks\\Blood-N-Wine-2-Music-II.zip":{"sha512":"8b6dcfb6ce4a0eba037edd5de416c2123955544a156b445f0aa66a3ce65fff3a659ed8dce9a4aadd9882809d2cecdfc1ced9d426e83744c0133febf9c45f224c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"4r1Lgilt","slug":"blood-n-wine-2-music-ii","project_type":"resourcepack","team":"kyPvDJY4","title":"Blood N Wine 2 Music II","description":"Blood N Wine 2 Music II Assets","body":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #9a0403; font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Checkout my other Mods/Modpacks!</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/blood-n-wine-2-lite\"><strong>Blood N Wine 2 Lite 1.18.1 (click me)</strong></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/blood-n-wine-2\">Blood N Wine 2 1.16.5 (click me)</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/blood-n-wine\"><strong>Blood N Wine 1.12.2 (click me)</strong></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/farlands-forge\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Farlands [FORGE/FABRIC] (click me)</strong></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-armor-curve\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>[FABRIC] Armor Curve (click me)</strong></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Need a server to play with friends?

There are 3 tiers of scarecrows, each having 2 variants. Every tier will scare monsters in an increasingly larger area given that monster can see the scarecrow (details below). The first variant of each tier will only scare monsters, the second one of each tier will additionally scare animals. The respective mobs are also unable to spawn in the area affected by a scarecrow.\n\nWhen a mob is scared by a scarecrow, it will run away from the scarecrow, crying for help by making tons of noise (except for creepers, because they're super quiet). Sometimes, if you lure them into the scarecrow's area, mobs will be too fixated on a player to notice the scarecrow, but they will eventually run away.\n\nScarecrows are built in a similar manner to iron or snow golems, placing a (carved) pumpkin last. Placing a Jack o' Lantern last will make the scarecrow emit light. You'll also notice, that every scarecrow has arms (the sticky things on their side). Those arms are placed by rightclicking a block with a stick. Arms can only be placed on the side of a block. How exactly you build each type is shown in the images below. \n\nTo remove a scarecrow, break the block it's placed on. You'll get back all the blocks and items the scarecrow was made of.\\\n1.13+ only: If you do not place the pumpkin last, rightclick it to build the scarecrow. Only Carved Pumpkins and Jack o' Lanterns work.\n\n### Types\n#### Tier 1\n<u>Size:</u> 2 blocks tall\\\n<u>Affected Area:</u> 10 blocks\n\n<u>Variant 1 Name:</u> Spoopy Scarecrow\\\n<u>Blocks (from top to bottom):</u> Pumpkin/Jack o' Lantern, Clay, Sticks on the sides.\\\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fHP1etX.png\" width=\"407\" height=\"464\" />\n\n<u>Variant 2 Name:</u> Super Spoopy Scarecrow\\\n<u>Blocks (from top to bottom):</u> Pumpkin/Jack o' Lantern, Chiseled Stone Bricks, Sticks on the sides.\\\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LCxB7rH.png\" width=\"379\" height=\"441\" />\n\n<u>Note:</u> This mod is balanced, because it has clay in it.\n\n#### Tier 2\n<u>Size:</u> 3 blocks tall\\\n<u>Affected Area:</u> 25 blocks\n\n<u>Variant 1 Name:</u> Spooky Scarecrow\\\n<u>Blocks (from top to bottom):</u> Pumpkin/Jack o' Lantern, Netherrack, Sticks on the sides, Nether Brick Fence.\\\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kTLbDzl.png\" width=\"323\" height=\"424\" />\\\n(Hey, you know this guy from the logo!)\n\n<u>Variant 2 Name:</u> Super Spooky Scarecrow\\\n<u>Blocks (from top to bottom):</u> Pumpkin/Jack o' Lantern, Quartz Pillar, Sticks on the sides, Nether Brick Fence.\\\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/b7NDZr3.png\" width=\"357\" height=\"519\" />\n\n<u>Note:</u> The Spooky Scarecrow is pretty full of himself because he's featured in the logo.\\\n<u>Note:</u> That's a Nether Brick Fence, no other fence works.\n\n#### Tier 3\n<u>Size:</u> 4 blocks tall\\\n<u>Affected Area:</u> 50 blocks\n\n<u>Variant 1 Name:</u> Scary Scarecrow\\\n<u>Blocks (from top to bottom):</u> Pumpkin/Jack o' Lantern, End Stone, Sticks on the sides, End Rod (facing down), End Rod (facing up).\\\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/l94ncUd.png\" width=\"349\" height=\"566\" />\n\n<u>Variant 2 Name:</u> Super Scary Scarecrow\\\n<u>Blocks (from top to bottom):</u> Pumpkin/Jack o' Lantern, Purpur Pillar, Sticks on the sides, End Rod (facing down), End Rod (facing up).\\\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nCQtMOk.png\" width=\"354\" height=\"543\" />\n\n<u>Note:</u> The placing of the end rods matters.\n\n### Config\nThis mod has a configuration file, in which you can define the ranges of each scarecrow type as well as whether it scares animals or not. The options are sorted into sections based on the scarecrow name, which you can find above each picture.\n\nYou are allowed to use this mod in any modpack.","published":"2022-11-20T18:51:11.082092Z","updated":"2023-12-11T14:30:21.160178Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1281,"followers":1,"categories":["game-mechanics","mobs","utility"],"additional_categories":["decoration"],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["fSj4EWTH","hbfI9tGy","LgMBx8V7","yaasKKfQ","vDKK9PTw","xbkk11bf","QvtooI54","vXr4V3GX","dYRVh5c4","iC3fRCNR","iXhEMbAZ","RRWqeHMx","7HyuB3ET","7lsroQCu","asgLTnQn","dICVVGnK","S5I9Iwt1","dhRFrpQB"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qsyWSAhB/6457939d9bee582d05c21e91203fc70d53dbe5ff.png"},"version":{"id":"xbkk11bf","project_id":"qsyWSAhB","author_id":"j2vvv1qU","featured":false,"name":"1.16.5-v1.0.8","version_number":"v1.0.8","changelog":"- Update to 1.16.2+","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-11-20T19:31:29.276091Z","downloads":667,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"9ec689802e7345197ffab1c807d99df18bed5d1c","sha512":"951b26904f7edd61f95e3d98ff75abc83a973b9b45019eb1a602ff3fda47d05908b349aa15218ac711f9d26c8aadb43b182db3cca87bffa60aa93560ec28267c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qsyWSAhB/versions/xbkk11bf/scarecrows-1.16.5-v1.0.8.jar","filename":"scarecrows-1.16.5-v1.0.8.jar","primary":true,"size":74387,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"PDiwQrHP","user":{"id":"j2vvv1qU","username":"bl4ckscor3","name":"bl4ckscor3","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/j2vvv1qU/a33ac86ccb684d2fb402233151412018699f1c3c.png","bio":"","created":"2021-06-27T09:17:06.110534Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"scarecrows-1.16.2-v1.0.8.jar"},"mods\\dynviewdist-2.0.jar":{"sha512":"f55a2046af82bf83f3ce01818692a5cb610b3602ca50939d8c0e174d0f876c1bece155d7f8025ff66531305a976096990660fe0454047d9b70ad368b091bae65","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Dynamic view distance","description":"Dynamic view distance mod which dynamically changes chunk view distance to fit server load\n","authors":[],"version":"1.8","icon":null,"project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"dynviewdist-2.0.jar"},"mods\\BlockySiege-3.0.4-1.16.5.jar":{"sha512":"0124670e4a44ce1b1110de27f0185c0fe9f0354adf586132eb69ae3458b6c28472d768638bd2fb0082ca2536c5e05123e597877363296d35dc7c3ecd9d26430c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Blocky Siege","description":null,"authors":["bryan, MCreator"],"version":"1.0.0","icon":"C:\\Users\\NukelordBrown\\AppData\\Roaming\\com.modrinth.theseus\\caches\\icons\\1860680418861c5cbcc6d2abaf6b4b1d65a7a5b9.png","project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"BlockySiege-3.0.4-1.16.5.jar"},"mods\\cloth-config-4.17.101-forge.jar":{"sha512":"3a5755660b09408b5cce7ba8232f1edb5d5e5acbed58577da5522e5c84023150445146badd7133346b6abe57d8b22a8f578839c0e9a3df0183c9b860ace17fa4","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"9s6osm5g","slug":"cloth-config","project_type":"mod","team":"z9omIQMN","title":"Cloth Config API","description":"Configuration Library for Minecraft Mods","body":"[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZEORx0F.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\"/>](https://discord.gg/Vs9AVkxjYY) [<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LrVLC2a.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"201\"/>](https://www.patreon.com/shedaniel)\n\nCloth Config API is a config screen api.\n\n### Developers Wiki\n[https://shedaniel.gitbook.io/cloth-config/](https://shedaniel.gitbook.io/cloth-config/)\n\nNeed a server to play with friends?

TexTrue, which is a fork of Magnesium/Rubidium Extra by TeamDeusVult.\n\nThis fork will NOT be ported to other versions.\n## Difference\n### Deletion\nRemove the Fog toggle setting as it cannot work well and is duplicate with [Embeddium Extension](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/embeddium-extension) mod's setting (which works well)\n\nRemove its tweak on Rubidium/Embeddium's MultidrawChunkRenderBackend (It's valid in Rubidium/Embeddium's old versions but goes wrong in new versions), to fix the chunk flicker issue.\n\nBorderless fullscreen feature and true darkness feature are also removed, you should use [Windowed Fullscreen](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/windowed-fullscreen) and [Total Darkness](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/total-darkness) instead.\n\n### Addition\nAdd feature from [TDV Tweaks](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tdv-tweaks) & [FastChest](https://modrinth.com/mod/fastchest) & [VideoTape](https://modrinth.com/mod/videotape) & [Clear Skies](https://modrinth.com/mod/clear-skies) (all disabled by default) and add video setting for them.\n\nUpdate related mixin to get compatible with latest rubidium for the Fade In Chunks feature.\n\nAdd memory usage percentage and game playing time that append after the fps viewer (all disabled by default).\n\nAdd particles culling based on their distance from the client player (Distance configurable, feature disabled by default).\n\nDisable the warning when you firstly enter multiplayer screen.\n\nDisable OpenGL debug message.\n#### Configuration\nChunks Fade In quality config has been refactored to configurable fading speed to achieve higher configurability.\n\n(Tile) Entity List. You can write (tile) entities' registry name in entitylist config so these entities will never be affected by the \"Max Entities View Distance\" rule.\n\nModID List. You can write ModID(s) in entitylist config so the (tile) entities of the mod(s) will always be rendered and not affected by the \"Max Entities View Distance\" rule.\n## Misc\n[![image](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/75401fe6-76e7-471c-89e5-1edd37a950ad.webp)](https://bisecthosting.com/kasualix)","published":"2023-12-07T09:24:19.065219Z","updated":"2024-02-15T08:22:51.431099Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1403,"followers":6,"categories":["management","optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["VcynHJJv","TgdlIfo0","58tfUwuo","fD4mAhDh","WmbLwQJ6"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aa5wOF1Y/f8b5696e91ab0c258d603594f451775bfd4580d3.jpeg"},"version":{"id":"WmbLwQJ6","project_id":"aa5wOF1Y","author_id":"yoApeVOc","featured":false,"name":"1.11.9","version_number":"1.11.9","changelog":"# 1.11.8\n- Setup auto-publish tasks, update FG & Gradle version\n- move FPSViewer-related rendering codes out of mixin.\n- Add optional GPU Usage percentage ","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-15T08:22:52.654333Z","downloads":575,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"5a989b372e045ddcacdea5428f2d32a42d47739c","sha512":"824cbcfe2f974a76dc71140c52005e033a708a7b999dff11db3e7c2362321a47f8e21a3114dc9585822659e5dbf74b7dd49bd51be406a5dffc2632943f654c35"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aa5wOF1Y/versions/WmbLwQJ6/embeddiumextras-mc1.16.5_v1.11.9.jar","filename":"embeddiumextras-mc1.16.5_v1.11.9.jar","primary":true,"size":106252,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"26435471818cebc666b9b981be74ba2f6c45de49","sha512":"56df9b61db33c407a1d0d5aa181bb5770ef8c0f50879945fe0a8a85b4cebf3bda43f6879ef1bf9530529cf352793f6e791a7ac7c2cd3fe91e8540be817e2c729"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aa5wOF1Y/versions/WmbLwQJ6/embeddiumextras-mc1.16.5_v1.11.9-sources.jar","filename":"embeddiumextras-mc1.16.5_v1.11.9-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":63908,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"xI6Ovvtt","user":{"id":"yoApeVOc","username":"Kasualix","name":"Catastrophe Chou","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110756250?v=4","bio":"\nمكتوب\n","created":"2022-08-15T11:08:18.078827Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"embeddiumextras-mc1.16.5_v1.11.9.jar"},"mods\\geckolib-forge-1.16.5-3.0.106.jar":{"sha512":"d940e453a54f776131025c686ce874d2a20499d934b090d338ecc4f2b749c6218faff6479d260d2c8ba2d4be6128f493acedf7261727806fc237712064d99591","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"8BmcQJ2H","slug":"geckolib","project_type":"mod","team":"XGT1SohE","title":"Geckolib","description":"A 3D animation library for entities, blocks, items, armor, and more!","body":"<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/nQsXG5b/Geckolib-Banner.jpg\" alt=\"logo\"/> \n\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/sJb8TVjW\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/730912704776110121?color=green&label=Discord&logo=Discord&logoColor=green&style=for-the-badge\" alt=\"discord\"/></a> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/geckosmods\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https://shieldsio-patreon.vercel.app/api?username=geckosmods&type=patrons&style=for-the-badge&color=green&logoColor=green\" alt=\"patreon\"/> </a>\n\n<h1 style=\"font-size:10vw\">GeckoLib is an animation engine for Minecraft Mods, with support for complex 3D keyframe-based animations, 30+ easings, concurrent animation support, sound and particle keyframes, event keyframes, and more.

It's available for Forge and Fabric.\n\nWhile not a direct replacement, I intend to support [Better Controls](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-controls) in the future and eventually stop updating Better Sprinting.\n\n## Features\n- Sprint key can be set to *Tap* or *Hold* mode\n- Toggle keys for sprinting and sneaking\n- Option to turn off double tapping W\n- Option to sprint in all directions in singleplayer\n- Configurable speed boost when flying in creative/spectator mode\n- Option to continue flying when touching the ground\n\n- To configure the mod, click the Better Sprinting button in Controls, or press the configuration key in-game (default: 'O')\n- To configure update notifications in Minecraft 1.13/1.14, open the *config* folder (same location as the *mods* folder), and edit the *bettersprinting-client.toml* file in a text editor\n\n### Tips\n- While sprinting, press the Sprint key again to stop\n- Opening a GUI while toggle sneaking makes you automatically stand up until you close it\n- LAN multiplayer allows sprinting in all directions if the host has the mod installed\n\n### Servers\nUse the **/bettersprinting** admin command to enable special features, or automatically disable the mod for players on the server. If you don't have a Forge server, you can read about the [server protocol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chylex/Better-Sprinting/master/src/main/java/chylex/bettersprinting/server/ServerNetwork.java) to implement a custom plugin and benefit from the features.\n\n![Screenshot of mod configuration](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fyBGPUFt/images/9dea230e38391c2b3a66f755b8c3a4004c1725ac.png)\n\n## Installation Guide\n### Client\n1. Download and run [Forge installer](https://files.minecraftforge.net/)\n2. Select **Install client**, and click OK\n3. Start the **Minecraft Launcher**\n4. Visit the **Installations** tab, and click the **Forge** profile\n5. Open the folder shown in **Game directory**, and create a folder named **mods** inside it\n6. [Download Better Sprinting](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/better-sprinting/files) and place the file into the **mods** folder\n\n### Server\n1. Download and run [Forge installer](https://files.minecraftforge.net/)\n2. Select **Install server**, don't forget to **change the installation folder**, and click OK\n3. Create a folder named **mods** in the server folder\n4. [Download Better Sprinting](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/better-sprinting/files) and place the file into the **mods** folder\n5. Start the server by running **forge-<version>.jar**\n\n### Old Versions\n- Old releases for Minecraft versions between 1.2.5 - 1.8 are available in the [archive](http://archive.chylex.com/files/mods/Better%20Sprinting/)\n- If you experience a mod conflict, try installing [PlayerAPI Core](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/player-api/files) (only applies to versions 2.0.3 and older)\n- In 1.7.10, vanilla clients cannot join Forge servers; if you install the mod on a 1.7.10 server, your users will need to install Forge (the mod itself is not required)\n\n## License / Modpacks\nOfficial files released after 12 June 2019 are licensed under [MPL-2.0](https://github.com/chylex/Better-Sprinting/blob/master/LICENSE), which allows you to use them in modpacks.\n\nTo verify, open the *.jar* file in an archive program, view the included *LICENSE* file, and ensure the first line reads *Mozilla Public License Version 2.0*.\n\nIf the *LICENSE* file is missing, you must follow Hardcore Ender Expansion 1's [License and Modpack Guidelines](http://hee.chylex.com/license).\n","published":"2023-08-11T13:30:43.621291Z","updated":"2023-08-11T13:30:51.582815Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2226,"followers":6,"categories":["transportation","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.7.10","1.8","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.9","1.9.4","1.10","1.10.1","1.10.2","1.11","1.11.2","1.12","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.13.2","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["f9URc1tz","djrKWaVw","Dg2tmZfv","Je8JG8PL","BZijTg4a","naRRrj4b","HboKEcsS","coy8wTvI","Enm5A18X","iWwl85vD","btOK4wAu","H7OU1iUI","rTIUlf7O","fHMzLE6k","viThp9Ne","J6TqZcg8","PLJneQZN","BuzBAkIS","r0tO47xc","4A4tZTaI","E1tgEIKO","g9TR7eh8","zQkEkCZt","xSEHWhS2","CiJP55WA","nMFJ8taI","li8YHT6B","JXjPHKkL","e7lg66PK","550wPBBw","Gr8eJKEU","eWYsfn8R","pAIkU4AP","JONA8dkX","xswRoIm1","de4kK4oz","wkTAIThh","gIj4KI5S"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fyBGPUFt/cdf9f5443abb7b65389d8722c2cb288c62a6893f.png"},"version":{"id":"gIj4KI5S","project_id":"fyBGPUFt","author_id":"mL6r9Xal","featured":false,"name":"Release 3.2.0","version_number":"3.2.0","changelog":"<p>- Updated to Minecraft 1.16.3</p>","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-11T13:30:52.323233Z","downloads":57,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"65115679ee8a04c74773e5c0032c2149004e16fb5a89846f577305ff0f538ae1032c9d1091a3e3a235983752e2a6a109c3958efd99e8c872a97cec81bb142935","sha1":"7e433687fd22e5ea70f064ff558d7abba7c03b3d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fyBGPUFt/versions/gIj4KI5S/BetterSprinting-1.16.3-v3.2.0.jar","filename":"BetterSprinting-1.16.3-v3.2.0.jar","primary":true,"size":103080,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"OZHhxv4Y","user":{"id":"5m2P2LwC","username":"chylex","name":"","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3685160?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-12-10T05:31:00.453503Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":false},"file_name":"BetterSprinting-1.16.3-v3.2.0.jar"},"mods\\JustEnoughProfessions-1.16.5-1.2.2.jar":{"sha512":"db9a9de71b7da0149589eada50d9f8d8e2c3df127a15aa1a6f89339122f4049fa6dbce1949d39e8fd6717cc117b829ba752384865c6892731f7001d2ee0e34c7","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"kB56GtWA","slug":"just-enough-professions-jep","project_type":"mod","team":"Kxgfhtlq","title":"Just Enough Professions (JEP)","description":"A JEI addon that adds profession workstations","body":"This mod adds new functionality to <a title=\"Just Enough Items\" href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei\"><strong>JEI</strong></a>.

Minecraft takes half an eternity to start - even though I have a solid pc setup.\nAn up-to-date computer takes <strong>7 minutes</strong>, a setup of 2015 approx. 15 min and a notebook of 2018 even needs more than 20 min to launch minecraft.\nThat's not really good.</p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</h5>\n<h4><span class=\"emoji-icon-wrap\">🔭</span><b> <strong>Roadmap</strong></b></h4>\n<p>At the moment Lightspeed decreases minecraft's launch time by approx. 48% - 62%. Every future update aims to improve it at least by 10%.<br />My final goal is that Lightspeed make your launch <strong>3 to 4 times faster</strong> than without using it. <br />Meaning an unoptimized launch of 7 minutes should <strong>be reduced to 2 minutes</strong>, 15 minutes to 4 minutes and so on. <br /><strong>If you like this mod,&nbsp;</strong>I would be happy if you post a comment with your inital launch time and the time achieved by using Lightspeed.</p>\n<h5>&nbsp;</h5>\n<h4 class=\"LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md\">🧭<strong>Maxims (Guiding principles)</strong></h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To ensure that my goal (improved loading times for everyone) is actually achieved, Lightspeed follows or should follow a few guiding principles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Efficiency over multithreading</strong>:&nbsp;Not everyone has a gaming cpu with 12, 16 or even 20 cores. Therefore, Lightspeed relies on caches and other measures to minimize operations wherever possible.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Minimally invasive</strong>: Even though Lightspeed is changing existing source code, it's not an completely overhaul or rearrangement of it. Every adjustment&nbsp;takes place with utmost care.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>(Ideally) no incompatiblilites</strong>: It's my goal that Lightspeed is and will be compatible with almost all mods out there - if you experience any crashes, weird behaviours or other issues please create an issue on GitHub.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Configurability</strong>: I'm aware that not all mods can be compatible with Lightspeed. But you can still use Lightspeed by disabling the problematic optimization feature in the config file.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>&nbsp;</h5>\n<h4 class=\"LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md\"><strong>⚗️How it works</strong></h4>\n<p>Minecraft and Forge are using some ineffiecient or redundant ways to load, hold and process data. I found some of these.\nI implemented an alternative algorithm per inefficiency and then observed the startup again to verify that the change resulted in the expected improvement.\nLightspeed's optimizations will mainly focus on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reducing file system operations (especially read access)</li>\n<li>parallelizing suitable processes</li>\n<li>caching computed results and data</li>\n<li>improved data structures</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>&nbsp;</h5>\n<h4 class=\"LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md\"><strong>🖥️ Test-Setup&nbsp;</strong><strong>&amp; Compatibilties</strong></h4>\n<p>The following section contains all mods that I'm using in my modpack. Which means that all of these mods should be compatible with Lightspeed.&nbsp;</p>\n<details>\n<summary>Mod list</summary>\n<p>AbsentByDesign AdditionalAdditions AdditionalLanterns AdditionalLights Alcocraft Alexsmobs AmbientAdditions AmbientSounds Appetite AppleSkin AppollosAdditionalStructures Aquaculture Architects Architectury Artifacts AutoRegLib AwesomeDungeonEnd AwesomeDungeonNether AwesomeDungeonOcean Awesomedungeon BadMobs Balm Beautify Bettas BetterAdvancements BetterAnimalsPlus BetterBiomeBlend BetterFpsDist BetterModsButton BeyondEarth BiomesO'Plenty BlockCarpentry BlueSkies Bookshelf BotanyPots BottleYourXp BottledAir Breezy BuildersAddition BuildersDelight Camera Canary Chipped Chiseled Citadel ClothConfig CofhCore ColdsStructures Collective CombatRoll Configured ConnectedTexturesMod CookingForBlockheads CornDelight Create CreativeCore CreaturesAndBeasts CrittersAndCompanions Croptopia CulturalDelights Curios DecorationDelightMod DecorativeBlocks DeeperInTheCaves Delightful Diet DimDungeons DisplayCase DoggyTalents DomesticationInnovation DomumOrnamentum DrawerFps Duckies DungeonCrawl DungeonsArise DynamicSurroundings Ecologics EntityCollisionFpsFix EntityCulling ExlineFurniture ExoticBirds Expandability ExpandedCaves ExtendedLights FallingLeaves FantasyFurniture FarmersDelight FastLeafDecay FastWorkbench FeatureNbtDeadlockBeGone FerriteCore FinsAndTails FixMySpawnR Floralis Flowery FloweryCore Flywheel FoodEnhancements ForgottenBiomes FramedBlocks Furnish Geckolib Gemsnjewels GoProne Goodall GrapplingHookMod Gravestone GuardVillagers GuiClock HappyHolidays Hedgehog HopoBetterUnderwaterRuins Hyle ImmersiveEngineering ImmversiveFX InControl Incendium IndustrialForegoing InfinityButtons IntegratedStructuresAndDungeons Jade Jeed Jei JeiIntegration JourneyMap Kiwi KnightQuest Koremods KotlinForForge Krypton LazyDfu LibraryFerret LightMeals Lightspeed MacawsBridges MacawsBridgesBOP MacawsDoors MacawsFences MacawsFencesBOP MacawsFurniture MacawsLights MacawsPaths MacawsRoofs MacawsRoofsBOP MacawsTrapdoors MacawsWindows Mantle ManyIdeasCore ManyIdeasDoors Mapperbase McjtyLib MmLib ModernXl MonkeMadness MoogsVoyagerStructures MoreBeautifulPlates MoreStorageDrawers MoreVillagers MouseTweaks MrCrayfish'sFurniture Multibeds NamelessTrinkets Naturalist NaturesCompass Nekoration Nightlights NockEnoughArrows NotJustSandwich Notes Observable ObsidianBoat OhTheBiomesYou'llGo Optifine OutOfSight Pam'sHarvestcraftCrops Pam'sHarvestcraftFoodCore Pam'sHarvestcraftFoodExtended Pam'sHarvestcraftTrees Paraglider Patchouli Phireworks PickUpNotifier Placebo PlayerAnimator PresenceFootsteps PrettyBeaches PrimalReservation ProjectVibrantJourneys PuzzlesLib Pyrotastic Quark QuickPlant Reblured Rechiseled RecipesLibrary RefinedStorage Relics Reliquary RepurposedStructures RexsAdditionalStructures RfToolsBase RoughTweaks Searchlight SecretRooms SecurityCraft Selene ShetiphianCore Shrines Signpost SimpleDivingGear SimplyHouses SimplyLight Sit SmarterFarmers SmoothChunk SnowRealMagic SnowUnderTrees SnowySpirit SophisticatedBackpacks SophisticatedCore SophisticatedStorage SoundPhysics SpiceOfLife SpyglassImprovements Starlight StorageDrawers Structory StructureGel StylishEffects SuperMartijn642ConfigLib SuperMartijn642CoreLib Supplementaries SushiGoCrafting SushiMod TerraBlender Terralith TheAbyss2 TheVeggieWay ThermalCultivation ThermalExpansion ThermalFoundation ThermalInnovation ThermalIntegration ThermalLocomotion Titanium ToughAsNails TownsAndTowers Trapcraft UTeamCore UnionLib Unstructured UntamedWilds UnusualDrill UnusualEnd UsefulBackpacks VanillaDegus Villagernames Waddles Waystones WildBackport Wilds XercaMod Xnet XtraArrows YungsApi YungsBetterDesertTemples YungsBetterDungeons YungsBetterMineshafts YungsBetterStrongholds YungsBetterWitchHuts mOREs</p>\n</details>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 class=\"LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md\">❗<b><strong>Important Notes</strong></b></h4>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>The optimizations will only show an effect if you are using several or a lot of mods.</li>\n<li>Some future optimizations may directly tweak other mods. If you don't want that Lightspeed directly improve other mods behaviour you can still disable it - but launch times will be better with keeping them activated.</li>\n<li>It will probably not be possible to reduce the launch time down or near to vanilla level (about 40 seconds), because in spite of optimizations there is more to do than not using any mods - But I will try my best to retract that statement at some point.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</h5>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>📝<strong>FAQ</strong></b></h4>\n<details>\n<summary>Questions</summary>\n<p><strong><b>Q: Can I use Lightspeed in my modpack?</b></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Yes -&nbsp; Feel free to include Lightspeed into your modpack - Remember to give credit and don't claim Lightspeed as your own creation.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><b>Q: Which Minecraft versions are supported?</b></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Lightspeed is currently available for </span><b>1.18.2.

Why?</b></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: This mod is still work in progress - look at the Roadmap section for more info. Maybe some mods you are using contain inefficient algorithms. Feel free to create an issue on GitHub with your mod list. I will try to profile and to improve it.

They are not simply pests and menaces, but the main cause of the loss of many lives. Only a brave few can slay a dragon. Even less can tame one.**\n\n**Welcome, to Ice and Fire.**\n\nIce and Fire is a mod created by both Raptorfarian and Alexthe666, which hopes to add dragons in a proper way. Currently, Dragons have two types: Ice and Fire. Fire Dragons breathe fire and roam most of the habitable world, whilst Ice Dragons inhabit the coldest places known to man and freeze their prey to death. Both kinds of dragons spawn naturally as adults. And news has reached us of a new discovery: Lightning dragons, powerful nocturnal creatures that deal blasting bolts of lighting to kill their prey.\n\n \n\nIn 1.2.0, Hippogryphs, Gorgons, and Pixies have been added.\n\nIn 1.3.0, Dragons were redone and Cyclopes have been added.\n\nIn 1.4.0, Sirens, Hippocampi, and Death worms have been added.\n\nIn 1.5.0, Cockatrices, Stymphalian Birds, and Trolls have been added.\n\nIn 1.6.0, Myrmex have been added.\n\nIn 1.7.0, Amphitheres and Sea Serpents have been added.\n\nIn 1.8.0, Dragons were redone and support was added for many other mods.\n\nIn 1.9.0, Dread Liches and Hydras have been added.\n\nIn 2.0.0, Lightning dragons have been added.\n\nIn 2.1.0, Ghosts have been added.\n\n\nWe plan on including additional mythical creatures. For further details check out our [discord](https://discord.gg/DAzxNagMHA) (for more up to date previews)\n\n\nIce and Fire aims to bring to you a revolutionary dragon experience.\nWe allow role players and mod pack makers to have access to all\nthe basic and advanced needs of a dragon hunter and tamer role. These\ninclude:\n\nDragon skeletons - these can be found in desert biomes and can be used to collect a few bones\n\nDragon roosts and caverns - where you can fight dragons and find grand treasures\n\nDragon eggs -

All code is open source and documented.\n\n🎭 Summary\n----------\n\nThe Conjurer is a magician inspired Illager miniboss. He owns a theater deep in the roofed forest biome. He has plenty of tricks up his sleve, so don’t take him lightly!\n\n🎬 Video Showcases\n------------------\n\nHere are some awesome showcases & videos about The Conjurer, created by us and the community. Please show them some love!\n\n<details>\n<summary>Video created by Modding Legacy</summary>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hPEnRp8kQOc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Video created by UltraUnit</summary>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eC_nW11y1fY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Video created by Cyberworld</summary>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7bevLfiMj70\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</details>\n\n📽️ Theater\n-----------\n\nThe theater is a brand new naturally generating structure you can find in the roofed forest biome. Each room in the theater has multiple variants, which are picked from randomly. The audience in the theater can be made up of Pillagers, Vindicators, the occasional Witch, and if you’re lucky, an Illusioner might come to watch.\n\n![theater](https://cdn.moddinglegacy.com/332191302903939325-06-23-2022-1655999104.png)\n\n🎩 Conjurer Hat\n---------------\n\nOnce you have stolen the show, or defeated him, The Conjurer drops his hat, a piece of fashion that will keep the Bad Omens away. The band on the hat is dyable similar to leather armor. He also drops 2-4 emeralds each time.\n\n![Hats](https://cdn.moddinglegacy.com/643654402754468438-357487446441813485-06-06-2020-1591502033.png)\n\n---\n\n🌐 Translate The Conjurer - help break the language barrier!\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll translators are credited here that have translated the mod to their native languages.

Contains most of the common/shared code of masa's client mods, and adds some inter-operation support between the dependent mods.","body":"# Description\n\nMaLiLib is a library mod for client-side mods, containing most of the shared code between the dependent mods.\nFor example it contains all the configuration options and serialization, a powerful keybind system, most of the Screen/GUI code and a bunch of other miscellaneous utility classes and methods for the mods that are built around MaLiLib.\n\n(The name is short for `masa's Litemod Library` because I have zero imagination...\nThe mod was initially created for the 1.12.x LiteLoader versions of masa's client mods.)\n\n## Mods that require MaLiLib\n\nMaLiLib is required by all of [masa's](https://modrinth.com/user/masa) client-side mods, starting from the indicated versions:\n* [Item Scroller](https://modrinth.com/mod/item-scroller/) - 0.14.0 and later\n* [Litematica](https://modrinth.com/mod/litematica/) - for any builds starting from around 2018-06-11\n* [MiniHUD](https://modrinth.com/mod/minihud/) - 0.17.0 and later\n* [TellMe](https://modrinth.com/mod/tellme/) - 0.6.1 and later\n* [Tweakeroo](https://modrinth.com/mod/tweakeroo/) - 0.8.0 and later\n\nThere are also a number of other client-side mods by other authors that are built around MaLiLib. The mod project/description usually indicates which mod(s) are required as a dependency.\n\n## Mod Versions\n\n**Make sure to download the correct mod version for your Minecraft version and mod loader from the Versions page!!**\n\n**Note:** There are both Fabric and Forge versions of the mod! Look at the tagged mod loader or the file name to get the correct version of the mod for your mod loader!\n\nThe file name always indicates the mod loader (for example Fabric vs. Forge) and the Minecraft version.\nThe file name is in the format:\n`malilib-<mod loader>-<MC version>-<mod version>.jar`\n\nFor example:\n`malilib-fabric-1.19.2-0.13.0.jar`\n\nThe required version of malilib for each mod version *may be* indicated in the changelog of each of the dependent mods.  But basically you want to get the version of all the mods that were the latest released version at the given time, to avoid version mismatches.\n\nThis would mostly become more tricky to figure out if you for some reason want to use certain older mod versions than the latest available version for a given MC version. Especially the 0.9.x and 0.10.x version era of MaLiLib for MC 1.12.2 and 1.14.x and 1.15.x (and maybe also 1.16.x still?) were kinda volatile for version compatibility. Also the releases based on the code rewrites, starting from MaLiLib 0.50.0 and going until the eventual 1.0.0 release change lots of things between versions, so getting all the mods from the same release date is crucial.","published":"2022-11-13T10:42:15.245705Z","updated":"2024-02-10T18:22:27.194234Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":164591,"followers":234,"categories":["library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.12","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.13.2","19w03c","1.14","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","19w36a","19w37a","19w38b","19w39a","19w40a","19w41a","19w44a","19w46b","1.15-pre1","1.15-pre3","1.15-pre4","1.15-pre6","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","20w06a","20w09a","20w10a","20w11a","20w12a","20w13a","20w14a","20w15a","20w16a","20w17a","20w18a","20w19a","20w20b","20w21a","20w22a","1.16-pre2","1.16-pre3","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","20w45a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5","21w05a","21w08b","21w13a","21w14a","21w18a","1.17-pre4","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","23w43b","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","liteloader","rift"],"versions":["xpR792B4","JOreljE2","GqJQjBaQ","pfIN0DE8","pEa77F0R","Kp1bn8Wo","DCEIIABn","eIuMPvKJ","tK3R1pP4","lnocmCI9","246Md9Ry","fOcHRevV","vgDmDfUm","Pu8xDtD1","ihvy9Q0Z","9EvFBimR","t8w76VqA","T1D4pEXT","YMIHZNjh","Euau0Egw","aCnJJxNJ","SKRFcsuu","sJ0vpGQ4","YCivjDgJ","T88fw3Go","vVcrJUjW","DQfN3nYw","aCdCLN9a","CLKlpHV8","eJs5BPcy","KBXbvUn5","glNpS49Q","nzayf0vT","AUMrKDpf","WkYufsBv","65EmNeSo","OA4srdXJ","oLSTbZXM","s2hC3mPG","SZbR4R54","Kspglts1","8tPQJhzV","2GXVNzhO","jwGlbCV3","EWs7FsDt","dBC9mwZ1","jMXcLH4A","xoL5eTJX","jzx8nfNF","TQqYSRpR","c4s7Zbz0","xDXYECLH","VBJVQr5k","Orgcteld","fpvuC4rF","j62IqVv1","xl3PIS2V","vDRdBvPr","GNZ1QcVs","9iSCpGAD","PanSzHVC","m4tKAdNx","CnyXjyOO","RFbJZzkP","3LX4TUEJ","brInzMZZ","re5ZP4ae","X8dJ9Bm8","SK74oJ3F","sLRwmtuK","4R0Gqncy","eRgu51VW","LOw3JVMo","AzlkNP6K","UReSBF4h","c7Fc4I7I","dR5rKVuL","Est0iV5r","unSNMf00","pQ04F8DK","M7H0THrh","UCs9tZPz","Z1z9d50i","g4mrp8Tw","mEKA79TO","NFLeefSE","rJuXJGbq","K9lL5sH3","lYJ3YGWO","adfbrE2r","MZ6YndxD","Q0t4XYBi","ofNjwck3","wbnzY76g","EKNDFW3Q","f02CW9Kn","IUSVeYEl","GGSCI6GP","1YdqB4Pt","aJFx8KWb","CDu87Ijx","ujZacei2","tP8wyMQb","RXunrjdh","JirOpckS","tHyxpoOI","BU2oeYjc","irVc8BCb","u2QfMTCe","PnnSBGlW","dWbSJQho","HiREfjem","dCJFeJSY","xvOB7EFh","SdX6LDeV","g7hz9tre","1h3OFjd5","flsBPpIL","dDzb9CtH","rOAuJf39","whn2i70Z","ChcwwPSb","GiLoOI8a","QDVOYcD0","m1uCj5FB","ROauLEoP","4sESRgiU","Gis19l54","SjGToM73","y7pWcuvN","zR6Y2P53","lUVomngZ","KT0odK2H","t9ow8DR1","Caa4rpKg","5ZOdZvFB","h3zHTglb","mpWdNRn1","SEgBLVXp","CSZC7Kg8","nVIcj6u9","AXxe1CWD","RB9rCbDS","LXxCKsbO","LUDJmeQ8","EJD0sMRf","ONcFAEMd","5dBlHNPp","sEdTPERW","n3rSKTxi","SB7tiPti","8dni8zmd","zVs7aEp7","iQzeIzoA","CsKg2NQk","goJg4U99","yn5ciBxa","bie47ObU","yXQKbbFN","7U8phHVA","tmL1GaA0","f7KQvBvd","1lxRNCyB","QscKmQ2D","YVnURsNX","54cA6VvF","zKgKuVqX","N37PPlGv","2lJvqczS","cm5bRnBe","8teYoIPA","5oaVbc3m","BYZbkbtD","deIiheQG","dBwOdoCw","IQkidUS4","Ylo1pzZT","6PDV12GO","cHOCOOv8","Uxcq4Jeh","5AHE21Q9","EKza0MGW","rEDRUNoN","WuABs62s","2nS83Qf7","5SAYCyFk","IjPDJthB","xENxlGYG","pfVHXuBE","jBH9KX9D","Afp8AWEJ","isJt6rth","KfknnBMq","Lav6afIY","HljUtdhE","LhSZt6EF","C5EHWwTF","IY24B9AK","gxgIbzfz","PbcpAEvc","O2DJgzRi","o0AtO0eq","Frx9MtJc","ym1OdFaV","Bg19XPU7","QXOpZ38S","HXSuzGfa","V21ryIsV","Tcv1nnVY","ForaIThv","xVVI2sNr","AJhIEGVJ","dQTgVbDe","WHsimdn0","FYMVqf2J","o041qH7e","AxTFzVcz","M3rtbAPE","3zGlToR7","HXBBAweZ","vEQ2PjZV","HQXz1vnM","k7Vm0Wka","jYVl3riT","GnPJLycX","OEchuJwf","qOW15k2e","V7yLDtJV","wzI0QkCv","YUdoXvUT","66WY7ZfT","ZeB749FP","kZJWQDi6"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GcWjdA9I/a530ae55df5e0c405f5cf1b3e4fd6163a398bdc3.png"},"version":{"id":"2nS83Qf7","project_id":"GcWjdA9I","author_id":"yduuH4WA","featured":false,"name":"0.10.0-dev.21+beta.1","version_number":"0.10.0-dev.21+beta.1","changelog":"-

[Retro]](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/redirectionor-retro)\n\nWe have changed our name from redirector to redirector, because the redirection targets are not only about directions but all enum values now.\n## Preface\nIn the well-known optimization mods for Minecraft, Sodium, Lithium or Phosphor, there is a common optimization concept: replacing references to element _values_ in enum classes with static final field \n values references.\n\nThis technique aims to enhance performance by improving access speed and reducing unnecessary computations when frequently accessing the constants.\n## Introduction\nRedirector is the complete implementation of this concept to reduce the required memory of the game.\n## Note\nRedirector should work on both the client and server and

Crashy is a crash hosting site designed specifically for Not Enough Crashes and Minecraft crashes in general. \r\nIt shows crashes in an organized GUI that is easily readable, and has some other nice features.

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes. Please try Sodium (on Fabric) or Embeddium (on Forge) instead!\nUsing OptiFine with ModernFix is not officially supported, and may cause issues.\n\n## 🖥️ Need a server?

This is useful for modpacks that want to advertise themselves, or for people who simply want a nicer way to show that they are playing Minecraft. \n\nThis mod works out of the box, but you can customize it to suit your needs. Please refer to the WIKI above for more info\n\n![](https://cdn.firstdark.dev/artpacks/srpc/srpc_config.jpg)\n\nHate editing config files by hand? Why not try out the simple to use, [Config Editor App](https://srpcupdater.hypherionmc.me/) designed for Simple RPC. This app allows you to edit the config file step by step and even includes a Preview to show you what your Rich Presence will look like.\n\nThis app is available on Windows, Linux and Mac. You can download it from [HERE](https://srpcupdater.hypherionmc.me/)\n\n![](https://cdn.firstdark.dev/artpacks/srpc/srpc_help.jpg)\n\nYou can always refer to the [WIKI](https://srpc.fdd-docs.com) for help, but while I try to keep everything as simple as possible and keep the docs as useful as possible, sometimes things go wrong or it just doesn't make any sense. \n\nYou are more than welcome to open an Issue on Github if it's a bug or suggestion, or for quicker support, you can join our discord and ask your question in the appropriate channel\n\n![](https://cdn.firstdark.dev/artpacks/srpc/srpc_perms.jpg)\n\nIf it wasn't clear from the description, you are allowed to use this mod in your modpack.

You can whitelist mobs under the Whitelist section.\n\nAn example of valid syntax is \"minecraft:pig\" or \"minecraft:pig;5\" which will make it so any pig spawner can only spawn 5 pigs before breaking. If the amount of spawns isn't set it uses the maxSpawnCount in the Whitelist section.\n\nIn BLACKLIST mode it's the opposite. The only spawners that won't break will be the ones in the blacklist. You can blacklist mobs under the Blacklist section.\n\nThe blacklist only requires the mob registry name. So a valid syntax would be \"minecraft:pig\".\n\n**The config is located within the serverconfig folder inside the world.

Do not report issues encountered with it to their bug tracker or in their Discord. I have my own [Discord server](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) for my mods if you would like to discuss, provide suggestions, etc.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nGenerally Embeddium should work out of the box with many more mods than Rubidium. However, given the scope of changes\nit makes to the renderer, it may have compatibility issues with some mods that use advanced rendering. Please open an\nissue if you experience problems. Some issues may require changes to be made in the other mod but it's good to have\nthem documented.\n\nThe [GitHub wiki page](https://github.com/embeddedt/embeddium/wiki/Compatibility#known-incompatibilities) has a somewhat-maintained list of known incompatibilities.\n\n**OptiFine is not supported** for obvious reasons.\n\n## Shaders\n\nFor now, please continue to use [Oculus](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oculus) if you want shader support.\nNote that Oculus is somewhat buggy, and your experience will probably be more stable without it. I recommend removing\nOculus if you do not need shaders.\n\n## Credits\n\n* JellySquid & the CaffeineMC team, for making Sodium in the first place, without which this project would not be possible\n*

Mushrooms","description":"Useful mushroom extension with glowshrooms, baahshrooms, magic, ...","body":"# Extended Mushrooms\n\nThis is a Minecraft Forge mod which changes some mushroom behaviour and adds mushroom related blocks, items and recipes.\n\n![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cech12/ExtendedMushrooms/1.19/material/store.png \"Logo\")\n\n## Behaviour\n\nHuge Mushrooms can grow at random tick with a chance of 1:25 like trees. A difference to trees is, that Huge Mushrooms can only grow on specific blocks. On Mycelium and Podzol a mushroom can grow at any light level, but on Dirt and Grass Block it can only grow at light level below 13. (configurable)\n\nThe blocks of a Huge Mushroom have also a changed behaviour. Mushroom Stem Block drops itself and can be used as a new wood type. Brown and Red Mushroom Blocks drop a related mushroom by chance. With Shears or a tool with Silk Touch enchantment you can get the block itself. It can be used as Wool to craft for example a red or brown bed.\n\nBy placing 4 mushrooms in a 2x2 area, a mega mushroom can grow.\n\n## Crafting\n\nThe Fairy Ring is a new crafting variant that allows you to combine items with the power of mushrooms. Place 8 mushrooms (tag: [\"extendedmushrooms:fairy_ring_mushrooms\"](https://github.com/cech12/ExtendedMushrooms/wiki/Fairy-Ring#creation)) in a circle to create a Fairy Ring. Recipes can be found in JEI or wiki.\n \n## Entities\n\nBaashroom (Mushroom Sheep)\n  \n## Blocks\n\nNew Mushrooms with own wood types\n\n- Glowshroom\n- Honey Fungus\n- Poisonous Mushroom\n- Slime Fungus:\n  \n## Items\n\n- Mushroom Spores can be used to turn Dirt into Mycelium and turn Cows into Mooshrooms (right click).\n- Grilled Mushroom is a new food item which generates 2 hunger and 0.3 saturation. It can be cooked at campfire, furnace and smoker.\n- Mushroom Bread is a new food item which generates 5 hunger and 0.3 saturation. It can be crafted with 3 mushrooms of any type.\n- Glowstone Crumbs are dropped by Glowshroom Cap blocks and 4 of them can be crafted to Glowstone Dust.\n\n## Compatibility\n\n### Enhanced Mushrooms\nMultiple players have tested the compatibility and in general it is compatible. Some recipes could overlap which can be fixed by using a mod like [Polymorph](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/polymorph).\n\n### Wood related mods:\nSince mod version 3.0.0.0 Extended Mushrooms is official compatible with [Every Compat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/every-compat) to be compatible with multiple mods which add wood related blocks and recipes.\n\nIf you find some incompatibilities with other mods, please let me know. :)\n\n[![asd](https://chris-voss.de/bisect_hosting.png \"Bisect Hosting Promo Code\")](https://bisecthosting.com/cech12)\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Can I use this mod in my mod pack?\nYes, you are allowed to use this mod in your mod packs.\n\n### Port to another Minecraft version? Which versions are supported?\nSorry, but I do not backport any mod to an older version. Here is a list of all supported and planned versions: [Minecraft mod versions of cech12](https://gist.github.com/cech12/662e37d2f8524037d9fef8fbe90bed5a)\n\n### Is there a Fabric version?\nA version for Fabric is not planned.\n\n### Where is the config file? \nThere is a defaultconfig directory, where you can find it. If you change something there it has only an effect on new savegames. For existing savegames you need to go to the serverconfig directory of the savegame. \n\n### I found a bug or I have a good idea to enhance this mod!\nVery good!

It is based on a rule system. The rule files are located in `config/incontrol`.\n\nThere are currently five rule files (as of 3.5.1):\n- **`spawn.json`:** with this file you can block spawning of certain creatures under certain conditions. In addition, when a spawn is allowed you can also alter some of the properties of the mob like maximum health and others\n- **`summonaid.json`:** this is a file that is structured the same as `spawn.json` but is only used when zombies are summoned for aid\n- **`potentialspawn.json (1.12 only)`:** with this file you can remove and add spawn rules under certain conditions. The rules in this file are used before the rules in `spawn.json` are fired so make sure that when you add a rule for new mobs here, the new mobs are allowed in `spawn.json`\n- **`spawner.json (1.16 or later)`:** with this file you can add spawn rules under certain conditions\n- **`loot.json`:** with this file you can control the loot that mobs drop when they are killed based on various criteria\n- **`experience.json`:** with this file you can control how much experience you get from killing mobs based on various criteria\n\nMore in-depth documentation can be found on [the In Control!

This reduces the amount of time and effort required to develop certain mods and features. The Library's code base is also tested in a wider range of circumstances and communities which can lead to less bugs and better performance in mods.</p>\n\n<h3>Features for Players</h3>\n<p>While this mod is primarily for mod authors, there are a few useful features for Players.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands</a> like /bookshelf hand to get item IDs.</li>\n<li>Many new <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs\" rel=\"nofollow\">datapack features</a> like crafting recipes that damage items with durability rather than consuming them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Features for Modders</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/blob/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/serialization/Serializers.java\" rel=\"nofollow\">Serialization for JSON/Network/NBT formats.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/util\" rel=\"nofollow\">Utility Functions.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/registry\" rel=\"nofollow\">Registry manager, including non-forge registry types, debugging, and statistics.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#recipe-types\" rel=\"nofollow\">New recipe types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#ingredients\" rel=\"nofollow\">New ingredient types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#loot-conditions\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot condition types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#global-loot-modifiers\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot modifier types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#item-predicates\" rel=\"nofollow\">New item predicates.</a></li>\n<li>Check <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wiki</a> for more!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

traditional Random with ThreadLocalRandom in minecraft codes for better performance and higher fps.","body":"# Francium\nFrancium is a Forge optimization mod that replaces some `Random` fields with `ThreadLocalRandom` for better performance and higher fps.\n\nThis is inspired by [Faster Random](https://modrinth.com/mod/faster-random) \n(But Francium doesn't change world generation or other stuff that makes huge difference from vanilla. \nThe only difference so far is the speed of squid tentacle movement speed initialization lol). \nHowever, Francium's implementation is wider and more rooted.\n\nThreadLocalRandom has a property: its `setSeed` method is not a supported operation, Thus, as long as a Random field is not calling `setSeed`, Francium can replace it with ThreadLocalRandom.\n\nClient side: Optional\n\nServer side: Optional\n# Benchmark Info\n```\nThe below benchmark is outdated due to the security improvement in 1.0.0.\n```\n\n```\nDetails: In Francium 1.0.0, To completely avoid the UnsupportedOperationException crash (and this is the only crash Francium may cause) of `ThreadLocalRandom#setSeed`, I did some security improvement so that if a Random field is setSeed, next it will no longer call ThreadLocalRandom. \n```\n\n```\nFor players, this security brings down performance improvement for a little bit, in my test my fps improvement dropped to 100 from 150.\n```\n\nMinecraft version: 1.16.5\n\nJava version: Azul Zulu Java 17 (highly recommended, check out [ModernFix's wiki](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/1.16---required-arguments-for-Java-17)!)\n\nWeather: None\n\nDifficulty: Peaceful\n\nSeed: -963323667424106092\n\nPosition: -139.746 102.0 -658.997\n\nModList:\n![img.png](https://github.com/MCTeamPotato/Francium/blob/1165/images/modlist.png?raw=true)\n\nEntities and item entities have been cleared by [Cuneiform](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cuneiform) commands /killall and /killitems\n\nYou can see my play time is 4:29 below, and in these 269 seconds, I have never moved or change my mouse too much (almost completely still).\n\nThis has been tested for three times, and the images below are from the third test.\n## With Francium Installed\nAverage FPS: 780 ~ 800\n![img.png](https://github.com/MCTeamPotato/Francium/blob/1165/images/francium.png?raw=true)\n## Without Francium Installed\nAverage FPS: 630 ~ 650\n![img.png](https://github.com/MCTeamPotato/Francium/blob/1165/images/vanilla.png?raw=true)\n\n# 1.19.2 ~ 1.20.1?\nNot currently. \n\nIn 1.19.2+, Mojang overhauled random number generation from Java's own Random to a custom RandomSource class. \n\nSo if Francium is to support higher versions, it may only be able to undergo simple replacements (Also, the new effects from this replacement is not at all guaranteed to be consistent with vanilla, which is what Francium didn't want.) in specific classes much like Faster Random, and may not be conducive to fundamental reforms like it be in 1.16.5 and 1.18.2, optimization will also be much less effective.\n\n# Misc\nJoin Our

New plants called \"springleaves\" are scattered about, which will launch the player at a high velocity depending on the direction of the springleaf. There's also an indigo colored wood-set called and few other decorative plants.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/x6kwLkY.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1116\" height=\"473\" /></p>\n<p>A New food source called Bouncer Nuts grow under the indigo tree branches. These will eventually become too heavy and fall off of the tree, breaking open into a few bouncer \"mobs\" which will become squished and dropped as an edible item after about 10 seconds. Squished Bouncers eaten or fed to ringlings, but they cannot be replanted and will only grow off grown indigo trees. Furthermore, another new mob spawns here, called the ringling. The ringling will eat bouncers dropped from nuts or fed by hand from the player. When ringlings are fed bouncers, they become full and will begin digging through the indigo eylium below them, they will occasionally dig up ancient roots and rarely a rooting blade. Ancient roots can be eaten to submerge yourself one block into the ground, it can also be brewed into a rooting potion, which causes this effect for a longer duration. The Rooting Blade will apply that effect on hit for about 3 seconds.</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YtHVhRs.png\" width=\"1128\" height=\"555\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">&nbsp;The Enderneath</span></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>The enderneath is an upside down ancient overgrowth, hidden below the end islands and lightly based around radioactivity. Lots of irradium ore generates within the biome and new threats called \"stalkers\" lurk here. Stalkers are very tough mobs, some of the toughest in the game as a matter of fact! They'll try to knock you off the platforms in the enderneath giving you an effect called \"burdened\" in the process, which will greatly increase your falling speed. Furthermore, killing a stalker will cause it to drop stalker its meat and ocassionally its teeth. Stalker meat is a very good food source since the stalker is a challenge to slay, and the stalker teeth can be crafted together with bismuth ingots to make a serrated hook, which has extra range and will bring mobs to your position when attacked.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>glow gourds, azure berries, and cerulean stalk are also found only within this biome. Glow gourds grow down from cerulean vines, and overtime they'll sprout open with fronds off the sides, which allows them to be harvested slices that cause radiation when eaten. Azure berries grow off of lichen-like vines. These berries are very useful as they provide levitation to any player that eats them, letting you save yourself from a fall or escape from the enderneath. Lastly, cerulean stalk can be found here, which is an opposite of bamboo that grows downwards and can be turned into a light blue wood-set.</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6VBFhrg.png\" /><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">The Ooze Seeps</span></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>The ooze seeps is a biome based around ooze and bubbles, with mobs and blocks to fit that theme.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ooze can be found here, which is a new liquid found exclusively in the end. Ooze has many properties such as :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Items, projectiles, boats sliding across the ooze surface.</li>\n<li>Most entities will stay completely still and not sink or float while in the liquid.</li>\n<li>You cannot drown in the liquid.</li>\n<li>Going in the liquid applies a new effect called \"enderstride\" which teleports the player to where they are looking randomly.</li>\n<li>Ooze can speed up the growth of some nearby crops.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">Big gas vents that produce giant bubbles are littered around the biome. They also have different effects depending on what liquid or gas is placed a block below the lowest part.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eleviblooms, a new crop, grows here. Eleviblooms will grow in multiple stages only on chorloam, and when harvested multiple elevibloom berries will begin floating into the air, eventually falling down. Eleviblooms can be eaten to encompass the player in a giant bubble, which can be popped by attacking it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gloops are a new creature which is also found here. Gloops will occasionally harvest grown eleviblooms and then eat the floating berries. If they eat enough of the floating berries they will eventually begin dripping jelly, which at this point allows you to right click them with a bottle and harvest the jelly. Bubble jelly can be eaten for a new effect, \"bubbling\", which will encompass any hit targets in a giant bubble. Furthermore, bubble jelly can he made into a bubble jelly block, which rapidly increases the velocity of whatever entity walks in it to that of the blocks direction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fumesplats also call the ooze seeps home. Fumesplats will occasionally fill up with ooze over time, and then splat the ooze all over its enemies, including the gloop, it's natural enemy. The splat causes a new effect called \"suffocation\". Suffocation will slowly drain the oxygen of any mob who has it, almost like air-drowning. If fumesplats are killed, they can drop a suffocation gland which can be brewed into a suffocation potion.</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FGJWq6E.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1126\" height=\"569\" /><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">The Gaseous Gardens</span></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>The gaseous gardens is an upper end biome which is based around the noble gases.

It is not affiliated with me and causes critical untrackable bugs/crashes.\n\n<p>Unlike many other minimap mods, Xaero's minimap keeps the <strong>aesthetic of vanilla Minecraft</strong>, which helps it be a more seamless addition to the game. It is also <strong>the first rotating square minimap for Minecraft. </strong>Among a wide variety of customization settings, there is an option for a <strong>circle-shaped minimap</strong> and a separate setting for <strong>locking the minimap's rotation</strong> (using a direction arrow instead). The minimap can display the surrounding entities, including <strong>players, mobs and items</strong>, as <strong>dots with a custom color</strong> or as <strong>icons (usually heads)</strong>. In addition to the default <strong>compass directions</strong>, you can place your own&nbsp;<strong>waypoints </strong>that are visible both on the minimap and in the game world.&nbsp;Waypoints help you find previously visited locations or reach specific coordinates, with <strong>optional teleportation</strong>. The minimap can display the surrounding blocks above ground and below ground (<strong>cave mode</strong>). These are just some of the features of the mod while there are many more. Please read the \"Minimap features\" section below for a more complete list. For the purposes of following multiplayer server rules, there are 2 mod editions, full and fair-play, the latter being designed for fair PVP.&nbsp;<strong>This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification.</strong></p>\n\n### Follow me on Mastodon (Twitter alternative)?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mas.to/@xaero96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mas.to/@xaero96</a>\n\n### Support me on Patreon?</strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/PatreonXaero96\">patreon.com/xaero96</a></span>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n### Features\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Look of vanilla Minecraft</strong>.</li>\n<li>Multiple minimap size options including automatic.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Multiple zoom options.</li>\n<li>Two minimap shape options: <strong>square or circle</strong>.</li>\n<li>Runs&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">smoother than a lot of minimap mods</strong>.</li>\n<li>Can be placed anywhere on the screen using the \"Change Position\" setting/screen.

This way the minimap will not be displayed unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.</li>\n<li>Potion effects to control the usage of the minimap or some of its features for the players on your server/map. The following potion effects exist as of writing this: <em>xaerominimap:no_minimap, xaerominimap:no_entity_radar, xaerominimap:no_waypoints, xaerominimap:no_cave_maps. </em>The effects are of the neutral type by default, but you can also specify a harmful type by appending <em>_harmful</em>&nbsp;to the end of the effect ID, for example&nbsp;<em>xaerominimap:no_entity_radar_harmful</em>.</li>\n<li>Translated to a lot of languages.</li>\n<li>Option to&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">lock north</strong>&nbsp;to stop the minimap from rotating and instead display the direction of your character with an arrow.</li>\n<li>Works both above and under ground thanks to the&nbsp;<strong>automatic cave mode</strong>.

Roof size 3x3 and above should prevent cave mode activation when standing under log blocks while cutting wood.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Waypoints</strong>. Practically an infinite amount. Can be teleported to (permission for teleportation chat command needed). Waypoints are rendered in the game world and displayed on the minimap. You can hide all or specific waypoints. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">B</strong>&nbsp;to create a new waypoint. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">U</strong>&nbsp;to list all the waypoints. In the waypoints list, you can add/edit a single or multiple waypoints, sort them, view waypoints from other sub-worlds/dimensions and much more.</li>\n<li><strong>Local and global waypoints. </strong>To clear the screen from unnecessary waypoints you can create local waypoints that, unlike global ones, are affected by the \"Max WP Draw Distance\" option. This enables you to set a single global waypoint for a large area/region and multiple local ones in the area/region. Only the global waypoints will be visible when you are beyond the maximum draw distance.</li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sets.</strong>&nbsp;You can organize your waypoints by sorting them into sets.

The default settings are meant for finding mob-spawnable blocks. You can use it for any purpose.</li>\n<li>Multi-world detection in multiplayer. If you install the minimap mod on the server side in addition to the client side, each server world should get a separate waypoints \"sub-world\". Otherwise a much less reliable world separation is used, which is based on the world spawnpoint. If you can't install the mod on the server side, it is recommended to turn off multi-world detection for servers that only have a single \"world\".

The mod sends a chat command&nbsp;to teleport you to the waypoints, which is <em>/tp @s x y z </em>by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla <em>/tp</em> command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the minimap settings with the \"Default Teleport Command\" option or per server in the waypoints menu with the \"Teleport Chat Command\" option. Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. Right-click teleportation on the world map uses its own setting for the command. You can read about it on the world map description page under FAQ.</p>\n<p>If the \"Teleport\" button is disabled, then it can also mean multiple things. The most common reason for this is manually using waypoints from a sub-world that isn't the \"auto\" one but still from the same dimension. If the \"auto\" sub-world isn't what is supposed to be automatically picked on a certain world, then select the correct sub-world and use \"Make Sub-world Auto\" in the waypoints menu Options. This will swap all waypoints data between the 2 sub-worlds and you'll be able to teleport to the waypoints, which are now in your \"auto\" sub-world.</p>\n<p>If the \"auto\" sub-world IS selected but the teleport button is still disabled, then it probably means that teleportation was manually disabled for the server/world. Check the teleportation option in the waypoints menu Options. If it's disabled, you can only enable it through the server-specific config file in the game directory -&gt; XaeroWaypoints. I recommend exiting Minecraft before editing any config files. And make backups from time to time.</p>\n\n### Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. If you use the world map mod and it has also reset, then please start by restoring it first before dealing with the waypoints. Read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the world map&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">description page</a>. Done with that? Please continue reading.</p>\n<p>Start by opening the full waypoint menu. Press U ingame to do so. Check the vanilla controls menu, if the U key doesn't work. Go through the sub-worlds listed in the top-right dropdown menu. All waypoint sub-worlds for the current server address should be there. If none of them have the right waypoints for the world/dimension that you are in,&nbsp;then the server address was likely changed. Find the old server address in the top-<strong class=\"bbc\">LEFT</strong>&nbsp;dropdown menu, select it and do&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make World/Server Auto</em>. You should now be able to find the correct sub-world in the top-right dropdown menu. If the right sub-world is already marked with (auto), which means that the sub-world is automatically selected for your current world/dimension, then you should be good to go. If the wrong sub-world is marked with (auto), then please continue reading.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Using the world map mod?</em></u><br />One of the most common reasons for the wrong sub-world being automatically selected is the incorrect usage of the world map mod in multiplayer (since version 1.6).&nbsp;Make sure you select the correct map for your current world before confirming it. It affects which waypoints are being shown to you. The menu for map selection is on the world map screen, if you click the bottom left icon (unless it's open by default). Consider changing the map selection mode to one of the automatic ones, if it fits the server you're playing on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic (auto). This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Not using the world map mod?</u></em>&nbsp;<br />The wrong sub-world being considered (auto) and therefore being automatically selected can be caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection, if you have it enabled (disabled by default). In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the waypoints disappearing.<br />If this happened because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your waypoints:</p>\n<p>1. Find the right waypoints \"sub-world\" from the top-right dropdown menu in the waypoints screen, it's the one with the waypoints that you need in your current dimension. Perhaps start with overworld?</p>\n<p>2. Use&nbsp;<em>Options -&gt; Make sub-world auto.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>3. Do the same for every dimension (enter the dimensions before doing it!).</p>\n<p>4. If it's a simple server with 1 world (no hub/lobby worlds, no minigame worlds, creative plot worlds etc), then also turn off \"Multiworld Detection\" in the same&nbsp;<em>Options&nbsp;</em>menu. You can turn it back on later if you ever need it.<br /><br /><em style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n\n### How do I add my own entity icons or override the default ones?\n\n<p><strong>First of all, make sure that you actually have the entity icons/heads enabled in the minimap settings -&gt; Entity Radar Categories, whether you put it on \"Always\" or \"Player List\". Just make sure that you know how to display them. Those are the icons that this section is about.</strong></p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.6.0 of the minimap mod you are able to override the default icons displayed for entities with your own sprites/images by making a resource pack (or including the required resources in your own mod). In addition to that, you are also able to add or improve entity type variants support (different variants of the same entity type having different icons) by creating a simple mod of your own or including some code in your existing mod. Although this is usually unnecessary for simpler multi-variant entity types (most entity types).<br />By default, the minimap mod renders all entity icons using the entity renderers/models bound to the entities. This supports all vanilla mobs and some simple bipedal/quadrupedal mobs whose models have easily identifiable head model parts (head, ears, nose etc). If the mod fails to do so, the colored dot is displayed instead.</p>\n<p>The relevant assets directory to the purpose of overriding the icons is&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/</em>. You can find it inside the minimap mod's jar file and extract the contained files/folders for your reference. The jar contains an example file for overriding icons of a mod entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>. The example file would corresponds to the entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_mod:example_entity</em>, if such existed. Please read the comments in the file&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;to learn about its structure, so that you are able to create your own icon definitions similar to it.<br />In addition to that,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/minecraft/</em>&nbsp;contains several example files for vanilla entity types that might require additional comments regarding the default entity type variants support. By default, entities have very simple variants support where the entity type variant ID is simply the entity's main texture resource location.<br />If you set the \"<em>debugEntityVariantIds</em>\" option in the minimap config file to true, then the variant IDs of newly encountered entities (variants) will be printed in the chat and the log/console.</p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.8.0 of the minimap mod you are also able to configure your own model-based rendering. Please read the comments in the example file&nbsp;<em>/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;for all the information you need to know.</p>\n<p>Check out this awesome project by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/babybluetit\">babybluetit</a>, if you want to have a look at a real implementation of custom icons or actually use it:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support\">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support</a></p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode and/or entity radar on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;n&sect;o&sect;m&sect;i&sect;n&sect;i&sect;m&sect;a&sect;p</strong> - disables the minimap completely</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

own.\n\n---\n\n### Creating a config:\nA config is created using a `ModConfigBuilder`.\nSimply create a new instance using `#ModConfigBuilder()`.\n```java\n   ModConfigBuilder builder = new ModConfigBuilder();\n```\nA value can be added to the config with `ModConfigBuilder#define` which takes a name and a default value.\nFor integer and double values a minimum and maximum value are also required.\n`ModConfigBuilder#define` returns a `Supplier` which should be stored to retrieve the value from the config.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> booleanValue = builder.define( \"booleanValue\", true );\n\n   Supplier<Integer> integerValue = builder.define( \"integerValue\", 5, 0, 10 );\n\n   Supplier<Double> doubleValue = builder.define( \"doubleValue\", 0.5, 0, 1);\n\n   Supplier<ExampleEnum> enumValue = builder.define( \"enumValue\", ExampleEnum.VALUE_1 );\n```\nA comment can be added to a value by calling `ModConfigBuilder#comment(String)` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> valueWithComment = builder.comment( \"this is a comment for 'valueWithComment'\" ).define( \"valueWithComment \", true );\n```\nBy default values are reloaded when world is loaded.\nThis can be changed to only reload a value when Minecraft launches by calling `ModConfigBuilder#gameRestart()` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notReloadedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be reloaded\" ).define( \"notReloadedValue\", true );\n```\nValues in COMMON or SERVER configs are synchronized with clients by default, to prevent this use `ModConfigBuilder#dontSync()`.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notSynchronizedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be synchronized\" ).define( \"notSynchronizedValue\", true );\n```\nValues can also be put into categories.\n`ModConfigBuilder#push(String)` pushes a category and `ModConfigBuilder#pop()` pops a category.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"special\" );\n   \n   Supplier<Boolean> specialValue = builder.comment( \"this value is in the 'special' category\" ).define( \"specialValue\", true );\n   \n   builder.pop();\n```\nA comment can be added to the active category using `ModConfigBuilder#categoryComment(String)`.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"client\" ).categoryComment( \"this, is a comment for the 'client' category\" );\n```\nAfter defining all values `ModConfigBuilder#build()` must be called to finish the config.\n```java\n   builder.build();\n```\nNow the values in your config will reloaded and synced automatically and the values can be retrieved using the stored `Supplier` instances.\nThis will work for all available versions, that includes Minecraft 1.12, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, and 1.19.\n\n---\n\n### Example Mod:\nFor a

Mobs","description":"A mod to blacklist mobs from spawning.","body":"<p>This mod provides a simple way for you to disable natural mob spawning. Once the mod has been installed you can modify the generated config file to disable spawning behaviour.</p>\n\n<h2>Usage Guide</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the mod from CurseForge and install it to your mods folder.</li>\n<li>Run the game or server once. After it has been loaded close the game.</li>\n<li>Locate the badmobs config file in the config folder for your game. This will be in the same location as the mods folder but not inside the mods folder.</li>\n<li>The config file can be edited with a text editor. Every registered mob will have options pregenerated for you. Once you have changed the file to your liking save the file and start the game again.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Known Issues &amp; Common Issues</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In Minecraft 1.19.3 and below disabling normal spawns will also disable spawners and spawn eggs. This stems from a bug in Forge that causes unreliable spawn information to be given to mods. The Forge team has fixed this bug on 1.19.4 and above however older versions will not receive this fix. This issue will not affect users on 1.19.4+.</li>\n<li>The mobs still spawn but they are invisible? This is caused by the server not having the mod installed or the server having a mismatched configuration file. You will need to ensure the server is set up properly to resolve this issue.</li>\n<li>This mod is required on both the client and server. You may be able to run it server side only however this use case is not supported.</li>\n<li>Want to make a zombie apocalypse modpack using this mod? I don't know why people keep asking me how to do this at least once a weak. That's not what this mod is for. You can disable everything except for zombies but there are better mods for that.</li>\n<li>My config file is being reset when I launch the game? This is caused by Forge detecting an error in your configuration file and resetting the file back to the default. This is user error and you will need to figure out how to properly edit the file.</li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

To go along with the new biomes, it adds new plants, flowers, trees, building blocks, and much more!\n\n## Info and Terms\n\n### Requires [![GlitchCore Icon](https://i.imgur.com/zC7XoOh.png)](https://modrinth.com/mod/glitchcore) [GlitchCore](https://modrinth.com/mod/glitchcore) for Minecraft 1.20.4 and above!  Also requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) for Fabric version.\n### Requires [![TerraBlender Icon](https://i.imgur.com/y2BgV5H.png)](https://modrinth.com/mod/terrablender) [TerraBlender](https://modrinth.com/mod/terrablender) for Minecraft 1.18 and above! It is not required for 1.17 and below, but in those versions you must use the Biomes O' Plenty world type when creating a new world!\n\nTo use the mod on a server for 1.18 and above, no changes to server.properties are required.  For 1.15/1.16/1.17, the **level-type** setting in server.properties must be set to ***biomesoplenty*** (level-type can be added manually if it does not appear by default).  For 1.12.2 and below, **level-type** must be set to ***BIOMESOP***.  You must use either a new world, or use an NBT editor to make the necessary changes to your existing world, otherwise our biomes will not generate.\n\n*You may include this mod in a Modrinth-hosted modpack as long as you do not rehost the mod and only use builds uploaded directly by us, you do not sell the modpack or additional access to the mod via any means, and you follow any and all terms listed in the license for the version of the mod you are using.*\n\n## Soundtrack\n\n[![BOP Volume 1 Album

Adds an option to choose the crafting result if more than one is available.","body":"Polymorph is a mod that solves recipe conflicts by letting players choose between all potential\noutputs shared by the same ingredients.\n\nWith a sufficiently large amount of mods, recipe conflicts are a common occurrence and the\nresponsibility for resolving these usually falls on the user or modpack developer, using datapacks\nor other tools to ensure that each recipe is unique.\n\nPolymorph offers an alternative solution, allowing all possible crafting and smelting recipes to\nco-exist regardless of conflicts.\n\n## Features\n\n### Crafting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/TkWswkG/polymorph.gif)\n\nWhen a group of ingredients matches more than one recipe, a button will appear above the output\nslot. Pushing this button will show a list of all possible results and selecting one will change the\ncrafting output to match. Polymorph will also remember the last selection as long as the ingredients\ndon't change, so repeated crafting actions are possible on the same selection.\n\n### Smelting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/QX9MNYM/polymorph-furnacedemo.gif)\n\nWhen a valid input matches more than one output, a button will appear above the output slot. Pushing\nthis button will show a list of all possible results with the currently selected result highlighted\nin green. Selecting one of the listed results will change the smelting output to match. This\nselection will be saved to the block itself and persist across world loading and unloading.\n\n### Smithing\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/GTCgL3S/smithingconflicts.png)\n\nExactly like the crafting screen, a button will appear above the output slot when a valid input matches more than one\noutput. Upon selection, the output will change to match.\n\n### Commands\n\nTo assist identifying potential conflicts, there's a command `/polymorph conflicts` that will try to identify recipes\nthat conflict with each other and outputs a list of them to your logs folder. Currently, the command will scan crafting,\nsmelting, blasting, smoking, and smithing recipes.\n\n### Mod Integration\n\n**Note for 1.19.x: Many of these integrations have not been implemented yet on 1.19.x.**\n\n**Just Enough Items**\n\nUpon selecting a recipe to transfer from the Just Enough Item screen, the output will automatically change to match the\nselection if there is more than one possible output.\n\n**Modded Support**\n\nMany crafting tables that are simply variants of the vanilla crafting table will automatically be compatible. Other\ntypes of support may or may not be compatible; below is a list of all mods that Polymorph has specific integration with\nand has already been tested for functionality.\n\n- [Applied Energistics 2](https://modrinth.com/mod/ae2)\n  - ME Crafting Terminal\n  - ME Pattern Terminal\n- [CraftingCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/craftingcraft)\n  - Portable Crafting\n  - Inventory Crafting\n- [Crafting Station](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafting-station)\n  - Crafting Station\n- [Cyclic](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cyclic)\n  - Crafter\n  - Workbench\n- [FastFurnace](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastfurnace)\n  - Furnace\n  - Blasting Furnace\n  - Smoker\n- [FastWorkbench](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastworkbench)\n  - Crafting Table\n- [Iron Furnaces](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/iron-furnaces)\n  - All furnace variants\n- [Pretty Pipes](https://modrinth.com/mod/pretty-pipes)\n  - Crafting Terminal\n- [Refined Storage](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/refined-storage)\n  - Crafting Grid\n  - Pattern Grid\n- [Refined Storage Addons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/refined-storage-addons)\n  - Wireless Crafting Grid\n- [Simple Storage Network](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-storage-network)\n  - Storage Request Table\n- [Sophisticated Backpacks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sophisticated-backpacks)\n  - Crafting Upgrade\n  - Smelting Upgrade\n- [Tinkers' Construct](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct)\n  - Crafting Station\n- [Tom's Storage](https://modrinth.com/mod/toms-storage)\n  - Crafting Terminal\n\nPlease request support by opening an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Polymorph/issues).\n\n## Affiliates\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.ibb.co/1G4QPdc/bh-illusive.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/illusive)\n","published":"2023-02-03T20:08:37.444573Z","updated":"2023-12-05T07:44:23.596047Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":510335,"followers":340,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["diy4s2XO","66Bkdq05","68l9BR3j","bT9w3gh5","hR8YtS8a","gxwQtnsA","vAv92Cl4","vuRsKlbz","cnPRpn78","tLFw14o5","haoNzeyv","750iJ3hO","rect6WEh","aYxyXMzJ","ChHxCoAb","STYYlkp8","wN8G3kAN","skUakdXR","uAleZkbS","SNlci35k","GKZ6KVfs","6Nyu412V","VQtXcHcR","bIDSNOm5","UlRasi89","l15iQHMn","AWwJD7yS","7L5hC81R","zncS6GGa","pJZr4yc3","8zhVFKEL","Sj0OPjRM","2BAp032A","FBfg7una","E4b6m0sQ","GcFD377O","km82tZAr"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tagwiZkJ/ed244c5829bde539763c7fffb55cb3194a349d66.png"},"version":{"id":"66Bkdq05","project_id":"tagwiZkJ","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"polymorph-forge-1.16.5-0.41","version_number":"1.16.5-0.41","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-02-03T20:17:22.739226Z","downloads":5653,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"528597bed3c5ef3e75507b7e606250d6dcd8a9f4","sha512":"1f354c9fc5873844ecdfe9bb8b1892d520c916bd6dd8b7352dac6eda717aa7099afbc9d7e070eef2b747f6582ee459031bc28550d01fbf2b8e6f5a5c189574df"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tagwiZkJ/versions/66Bkdq05/polymorph-forge-1.16.5-0.41.jar","filename":"polymorph-forge-1.16.5-0.41.jar","primary":true,"size":269665,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"a24d482014a60dbb1c7328c6b075c4f6e05c1771","sha512":"98017f61744707615d8128d395be85493370288e93f48f6ad4c03bc5b689281781d52afe7f2ae0128fae53c09c2d2a0d58a24a45730cdbfec7b67c4b4bb3e313"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tagwiZkJ/versions/66Bkdq05/polymorph-forge-1.16.5-0.41-sources.jar","filename":"polymorph-forge-1.16.5-0.41-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":169963,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"IyMJnv3l","user":{"id":"zbpHS3ry","username":"TheIllusiveC4","name":"C4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29991504?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-02-03T00:08:26.219982Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"polymorph-forge-1.16.5-0.41.jar"},"mods\\solpotato-1.16.X-1.1.0.jar":{"sha512":"b447dcbe785275526e42248efdeec4b9153d8bc5eca89654f2bf67d3f4e45719a53b1c4c32e51c4f2a79b48172fc5967355daafbc600796422346c69b3216295","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Spice of Life: Potato Edition","description":"A mod designed to encourage dietary variety!\n\nIt does so by rewarding the player with customizable benefits depending on how diverse their diet is.

Citadel, being a Library, does not add many features by itself, but rather provides a frame work for other mods when it comes to animating entities, loading .tbl Tabula and .obj Waveront models, and for keeping track of entity properties. Citadel's predecessor, LLibrary, will no longer be updated from 1.12.2, and from now on all of my mods will use Citadel. Citadel's code base is largely derived from LLibrary, and the code is used with permission from Gegy1000, the maintainer of LLibrary and its author in recent versions.\n\n \n\nIn versions 1.6.3 and above, there is also a config option for changing the cap on how many mobs spawn on chunk generation. This is useful when used with the many mob mods that require Citadel, as without changing this they can make it quite difficult to find vanilla mobs.\n\n \n\nDevelopers who want to use Citadel can read [the guide on how to add it to their development environment](https://github.com/Alex-the-666/Citadel/wiki/Getting-Started).","published":"2023-11-03T16:25:45.246822Z","updated":"2024-02-28T19:40:53.632594Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":225460,"followers":91,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["AhrngqR9","l54hCYzm","jWcSsP5K","LOHm0ffg","ge8ra0kG","u3vg28FG","AEa5lIzx","l1j29UHl","1xvYIdqx","aOl88G8l","k2akMR9x","Xdw9cSFG","rmDI9Owy","H2MVcwUf","3OJWvUG9","ssXkoBKk"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jJfV67b1/dea486e5291c6f8ca8813a22e1fa32fa14a4a47f.png"},"version":{"id":"AEa5lIzx","project_id":"jJfV67b1","author_id":"iBpwljlP","featured":false,"name":"Citadel 1.8.1","version_number":"1.8.1","changelog":"release for 1.16.5","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-03T17:08:42.496728Z","downloads":19706,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"6e158ecf8181c14de68df35aa81042f45b44c247316d71eb0bac66e0dfbda47f0d6c03286f1e4be63b5955c5430bc0daf9f6ab7d0d105cd9fd3c41315000a3e0","sha1":"cf60d0fc6b6d1357832c64d665870f555f23e19b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jJfV67b1/versions/AEa5lIzx/citadel-1.8.1-1.16.5.jar","filename":"citadel-1.8.1-1.16.5.jar","primary":true,"size":482439,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"rByA3asR","user":{"id":"iBpwljlP","username":"AlexModGuy","name":"AlexModGuy","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/iBpwljlP/921ad78a793efff6d03b582fa3dc1f06bb237426.jpeg","bio":"aka Alex Mobiles, Alexander Caverns, Alexthe668\n\nhttps://github.com/AlexModGuy","created":"2023-11-03T16:23:16.718366Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"citadel-1.8.1-1.16.5.jar"},"mods\\smoothchunk1.16.5-2.0.jar":{"sha512":"774229e8e4cebe7f2ff0740f6464bceb5e7e44e277ad7d4121aaf78e20637bc3c428a7c399ab8514062f0bd3ef4524ab505a7ba117bb50e171ff5f05a6aff043","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Smoothchunk mod","description":"Spreads chunk saves over time smoothly\n","authors":["Someaddons"],"version":"${file.jarVersion}","icon":null,"project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"smoothchunk1.16.5-2.0.jar"},"mods\\RevampedWolf-1.16.4-0.7.1.jar":{"sha512":"8cfb8a7f5be174ad8199cfc521551bb938aa3383c153c2684e82dcc8affb5391658d08190c4fd2dc51e1376a019218b50faace2b7889ddd5df8f5f8f6f7799bd","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"RevampedWolf","description":"This mod is revamped wolf mechanic\n\n","authors":["bagu_chan"],"version":"${file.jarVersion}","icon":null,"project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"RevampedWolf-1.16.4-0.7.1.jar"},"mods\\zombievillagersfromspawner_1.16.5-1.5.jar":{"sha512":"3451976450a258cac073b5a7889af948457eff2a7800f3057a51765102f31924cf7c4b92c973b3e5fc4043b170dca1f10f7034aaa1b27ad1ffbac04dc439ea32","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"wQlT8uIq","slug":"zombie-villagers-from-spawner","project_type":"mod","team":"M3fyINu4","title":"Zombie Villagers From Spawner","description":"🧟‍♂ Returns the ability for zombie spawners to spawn the villager variant, removed in 1.11.","body":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><center><a href=\"https://serilum.com/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/description/header/header.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"838\" height=\"400\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://curseforge.com/members/serilum/projects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/curseforge.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/user/Serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/modrinth.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://patreon.com/serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/patreon.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://youtube.com/@serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/youtube.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a></center></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Requires the library mod&nbsp;<a style=\"font-size:24px\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/collective\" rel=\"nofollow\">Collective</a>.<br></span></strong><strong><br>&nbsp;

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2023-12-13T09:52:16.752416Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":3213296,"followers":4676,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"6gwDuh90","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"2.1.1 (Forge)","version_number":"2.1.1-forge","changelog":"- Fix crash when the working directory of the game does not match the instance directory","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-11-08T16:48:32.899281Z","downloads":54992,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"3ae8dbe663156a8dec621d255856356444586905","sha512":"129eaec4743214258ed2f426192eba65f8268697fd37a0fc67f868d22b2eaea4d60d8e29100b034a00347672f830f3c4a4a3a94d2307d02f60c00ff4bd27f6a7"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/6gwDuh90/ferritecore-2.1.1-forge.jar","filename":"ferritecore-2.1.1-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":108557,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-2.1.1-forge.jar"},"mods\\EnchantmentDescriptions-1.16.5-7.1.23.jar":{"sha512":"8380d73e50d5f06bceab9038ebee493d4911be21400bc114fbe9bd3dd9fa7cb3dd92ae5dd7c580fe7d8cb7489059f7200cbc8eacc70762323c1bd31643ee44d0","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"EnchantmentDescriptions","description":"Adds descriptions of enchantments to their tooltip.\n","authors":["Darkhax"],"version":"7.1.23","icon":null,"project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"EnchantmentDescriptions-1.16.5-7.1.23.jar"},"mods\\giantspawn_1.16.5-2.7.jar":{"sha512":"5f572e169820beb368d6534a054a2968a4bef3d2f431213093a2e953ab0b2418ad60ef1e26fd2e9bd578bdb70c761236c5d1e889433956edb339391cc9e85340","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"iWwn7s9U","slug":"giant-spawn","project_type":"mod","team":"EarhvlkX","title":"Giant Spawn","description":"🧟‍♂️ Allows giants to spawn naturally with custom AI (based on zombies) and other tweaks.","body":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><center><a href=\"https://serilum.com/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/description/header/header.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"838\" height=\"400\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://curseforge.com/members/serilum/projects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/curseforge.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/user/Serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/modrinth.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://patreon.com/serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/patreon.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://youtube.com/@serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/youtube.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a></center></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Requires the library mod&nbsp;<a style=\"font-size:24px\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/collective\" rel=\"nofollow\">Collective</a>.</span></strong><strong> <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;This mod is part of <span style=\"color:#008000\"><a style=\"color:#008000\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/modpack/the-vanilla-experience\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Vanilla Experience</a></span>.</strong><br><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Giant Spawn is a minimalistic configurable mod which allows giants to spawn naturally.

Loader","description":"An open source resource and data loader for Minecraft.","body":"<p>Open Loader is a utility mod that allows data packs and resource packs to be applied globally across all save files in a game instance. This can be used by mod packs and servers to define custom recipes and other features for a wide range of mods. It can also be used to change textures, override tooltips, and change other aspects of the game.</p>\n\n<h3>Data Packs</h3>\n<p>Data packs are used by Minecraft to load recipes, loot tables, functions, and other game mechanics. Many mods also pull from data packs to handle custom recipe systems and other new mechanics. OpenLoader will load any data packs that are placed in the ~/config/openloader/data folder. Before 1.17 they were loaded from ~/openloader/data instead. OpenLoader can load zipped and folder packs. You can learn more about data packs <a href=\"https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_pack\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Resource Packs</h3>\n<p>Resource packs are used to define textures, translations, sounds, and other client data. You can use them to override existing resources or add completely new ones. These packs are loaded from the ~/config/openloader/resources folder. Before 1.17 they were loaded from ~/openloader/resources instead. OpenLoader can load zipped or unzipped packs.&nbsp;You can learn more about resource packs <a href=\"https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Resource_pack\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>FaQ</h3>\n<p><strong>Does this support mods like Patchouli or BotanyPots?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, packs loaded by this mod will behave exactly like packs loaded through the vanilla systems. So anything that works through the normal resource packs folder or the world datapack folder will work here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My pack is not loading?</strong></p>\n<p>If your pack is not loading it is because you have not followed the instructions properly or have made an invalid pack. Make sure you have the file placed in the right folder and that your pack has a valid pack.mcmeta file. Unfortunately I do not have the time or resources to help you debug your packs, but there are countless resources and communities available to help you make these things.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does pack load order work?</strong></p>\n<p>Any resource packs loaded by OpenLoader should be loaded after vanilla and modded resource packs. Data pack load orders are done on a per-world basis instead and can be very annoying. Initially all data packs loaded by this mod will be loaded after vanilla and modded packs. Any mods added to the game after that initial world load will load after all previously loaded packs but only for that world. This can be fixed by using Vanilla's data pack command to correct the world order on a per-world basis. If you need more consistent control over load order I would recommend a scripting tool like <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafttweaker\" rel=\"nofollow\">CraftTweaker</a> which is more robust and stable than the data pack system.</p>\n\n<h3>Files</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-loader/versions?l=forge\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-loader/versions?l=fabric\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fabric</a><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dark-paintings/files/all?filter-status=1&filter-game-version=2020709689:7499\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Pledge on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Darkhax\" rel=\"nofollow\">Patreon</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

In simpler terms, it's a large mod with lots of small features, aimed at improving the vanilla game. \nEvery feature can be turned on and off individually at your will, and most features contain further options to tweak the game just how you like it.\n\nWith quark installed, the title screen will get a new \"q\" button added to it. This button allows you to configure quark from inside the game, so you can easily turn off any features you don't vibe with.\n\n---\n\n# Features\n\nQuark has over a hundred different modules to play with, but here's a small highlight reel of our favorites:\n\n* Feeding Trough, for automatic animal breeding\n* Pistons Push Tile Entities, just like in Bedrock Edition\n* Japanese and Industrial style building blocks\n* Variant versions for Bookshelves, Chests, and Ladders for all wood types\n* Vertical Slabs, for all slabs already in the base game and Quark\n* Advanced Camera Mode for fancy screenshots\n* Toretoises, typo intended - new underground animals that grow ore on their back\n* Pickarang, a pickaxe that can be thrown as a boomerang\n* Trowel, a new tool to place random blocks from your hotbar, for paths or ruins\n* Emote system, allowing your character to do all sorts of motions from the chat menu\n* Reacharound Placing, which lets you place blocks under other blocks without being able to see the bottom face\n* Azalea Wood, replacing the Oak wood in Azalea trees with a pleasant green\n* Glimmering Weald, a new rare deep underground biome with glowing mushrooms and a cute new stone fae mob\n\nAnd many, many more!\n\n---\n\n# Learn more about Quark today\n### Visit the **[Official Website](https://quarkmod.net/)**\n\n* Visit the [Old Website](https://quarkmod.net/old) (for Minecraft versions 1.12 and prior)\n* Check out [what changed](https://vazkii.notion.site/Quark-3-0-Forge-1-18-Release-Notes-f22ef705b677421585f1208156a82b44) between Quark for 1.16 and Quark for 1.18\n* Download [Quark Oddities](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark-oddities), an addon focusing on more complex and technical features\n\n---\n\n# Compatibility\n\nQuark has built-in compatibility for a few mods, including JEI and TerraBlender.\n\nQuark may be incompatible with Optifine. If you are having issues using the two together, please uninstall Optifine and use a Sodium fork instead. \n\nAdditionally, if you are experiencing load crashes on 1.20.1, make sure your other mods are up to date, as any mods with integration from older versions will not function until updated.\n\n---\n\n![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/support.png)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/patreon.png)](https://patreon.com/vazkii)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/store.png)](https://store.vazkii.net)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/ch.png)](https://violetmoon.org/creeperhost)","published":"2022-11-13T03:56:40.716482Z","updated":"2024-03-24T01:57:59.770607Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":239508,"followers":439,"categories":["game-mechanics","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.9.4","1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["hUHoJ8IU","DWIopZ9p","z07wlDPM","MPJKDJmI","etJaVjwR","LQATRjJy","WVcMK697","e4xifKGM","NBd2DS3z","aLMcsDgH","KnCaeyy6","dNfuCJua","LrasAC1d","kDj0Fa7f","ywSMRT9e","kYMyxgpY","JThLxL7g","L9PRqT3G","Y5dUVG07","jchiLv3T","J2ikYge8","hxZ3rlaJ","4JhlPAZH","kGwG7wZ9","XV6IcdSU","ieBJd6v7","lYGV9kJO","NRZpkg7a","c7hTFL3Q","Nhn8Fatv","9ihQgCxD","qNOl7hL2","JXifdD4Q","SabfrHOJ","Vjf1btuB","8B3wEsDO","zyvZoGBo","l56EicrO","QipVljYx","htdpIhCQ","stYFI7Km","Bz5rycUV","2y7uLplb","nYJW7kfd","mxjAPHWr","ZqUi5HxP","M1mbFwiX","8po5DGR8","aKj03FLO","1d9CRYwK","sLfwgQ44","233kpcpB","a8AI08wJ","2u6IMNar","oTVxvQ9o"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qnQsVE2z/64151f8964bc6b81d968e814bf7344bbdfad27d0.png"},"version":{"id":"WVcMK697","project_id":"qnQsVE2z","author_id":"wlfGXpf5","featured":false,"name":"r2.4-322","version_number":"r2.4-322","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-11-13T04:07:51.438241Z","downloads":93716,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"c314a534737baba9416c4947e15f81c6243f9844","sha512":"59d9aa797f03ccd0c7fa269b9d51ceaadede87ebc4242ecbb9dbbfb5f642a934ead58b59975dcf9f3fcd57686c51b152029dc92097d948248e2660ed5ae5042f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qnQsVE2z/versions/WVcMK697/Quark-r2.4-322.jar","filename":"Quark-r2.4-322.jar","primary":true,"size":8796901,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"NvZ9ZhwE","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.16.5"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"nxIuTMRv","username":"GoesBySully","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/nxIuTMRv/f4400aa9bc0120732ae57903fab324e986e726f7.png","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-29T12:53:22.188525Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"BU21lLGA","username":"MehVahdJukaar","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24719182?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-21T07:42:29.648721Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"IV1Ji8se","username":"quat","name":"quaternary","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2068021?v=4","bio":"Dragon","created":"2020-12-24T00:27:44.019284Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"2pSgrUlO","username":"IThundxr","name":"IThundxr","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74031881?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-08-14T19:41:15.163217Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"W53r0fU4","username":"Siuolplex","name":"Siuol","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/43890828?v=4","bio":"","created":"2020-11-21T03:51:29.493313Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"kRXgk5E1","username":"Vazkii","name":"Vasco Lavos","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794735?v=4","bio":"holy hell","created":"2022-11-13T03:09:41.900759Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Quark-r2.4-322.jar"},"mods\\kotlinforforge-1.17.0-obf.jar":{"sha512":"dc6bcb9583d8cafdfd2b6394aadd5d68f96a5e9052822368e734476ea33b99e49ac9789f73a0ffd8053370420669f685dda9f0c1a6752431c1d33f6db9b4463e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ordsPcFz","slug":"kotlin-for-forge","project_type":"mod","team":"h8c6AwoX","title":"Kotlin for Forge","description":"Adds a Kotlin language loader and provides some optional utilities.","body":"Used to make mods with the Kotlin programming language.

All of these mobs fall into either two categories: most of them are real world creatures, like Grizzly Bears, Roadrunners, Orcas, etc; but some of them are purely fictional, like the Endergade and Bone Serpent. All of these creatures fulfill a necessary purpose, and either have unique drops, mechanics or functions, as there are no purely aesthetic creatures. That said, they also help make some environments in the game feel more alive. The models, textures, animations and AI are all stylistically compatible with the vanilla game's latest additions.\n\n\nThe new mobs currently added are as follows (fantastical mobs in blue, real-world ones in black, boss mobs in red):\n<details>\n<summary>New Mobs...</summary>\n\n#### In Release 1.0.0:\n- Grizzly Bear\n- Roadrunner\n- Bone Serpent\n- Gazelle\n- Crocodile\n- Fly\n- Hummingbird\n- Orca\n- Sunbird\n- Gorilla\n- Crimson Mosquito\n- Rattlesnake\n- Endergrade\n- Hammerhead Shark\n- Lobster\n- Komodo Dragon\n- Capuchin Monkey\n- Cave Centipede\n#### In Release 1.1.0:\n- Warped Toad\n- Moose\n#### In Release 1.2.0:\n- Mimicube\n- Raccoon\n- Blobfish\n#### In Release 1.3.0:\n- Seal\n- Cockroach\n- Shoebill\n#### In Release 1.4.0:\n- Elephant\n- Soul Vulture\n#### In Release 1.5.0:\n- Snow Leopard\n- Spectre\n- Crow\n#### In Release 1.6.0:\n- Alligator Snapping Turtle\n- Mungus\n- Mantis Shrimp\n#### In Release 1.7.0 (Mighty Monsters Update):\n- Guster\n- Warped Mosco\n- Straddler\n- Stradpole\n#### In Release 1.8.0 (Down Under Update):\n- Emu\n- Platypus\n- Dropbear\n- Tasmanian Devil\n- Kangaroo\n#### In Release 1.9.0 (Big and Small Update):\n- Cachalot Whale\n- Leafcutter Ant\n- Enderiophage\n#### In Release 1.10.0 (Ferocious Predators Update)\n- Bald Eagle\n- Tiger\n- Tarantula Hawk\n#### In Release 1.11.0\n- Void Worm\n- Frilled Shark\n- Mimic Octopus\n#### In Release 1.12.0\n- Seagull\n#### In Release 1.13.0 (Bygone Beasts Update)\n- Froststalker\n- Tusklin\n- Laviathan\n- Cosmaw\n#### In Release 1.14.0 (Come to Brazil Update)\n- Toucan\n- Maned Wolf\n- Anaconda\n- Anteater\n#### In Release 1.15.0 (Caves and Cliffs Update):\n- Rocky Roller\n- Flutter\n- Gelada Monkey\n#### In Release 1.16.0 (Atmospheric Update):\n- Jerboa\n- Terrapin\n- Comb Jelly\n- Cosmic Cod\n#### In Release 1.17.0 (Fan Favorites Update):\n- Bunfungus\n- Bison\n- Giant Squid\n#### In Release 1.18.0 (Fishy Business Update):\n- Devil's Hole Pupfish\n- Catfish\n- Flying Fish\n- Skelewag\n#### In Release 1.19.0 (Wilder Update):\n- Rain Frog\n- Potoo\n- Mudskipper\n- Rhinoceros\n- Sugar Glider\n#### In Release 1.20.0 (Very Scary Update):\n - Farseer\n - Skreecher\n - Underminer\n - Murmur\n#### In Release 1.21.0 (Forest Friends Update):\n - Skunk\n - Banana Slug\n - Blue Jay\n#### In Release 1.22.0 (Freshwater Update):\n - Caiman\n - Triops\n\n</details>\n\nMany of these mobs have unique drops or items associated with them. Following the traditional vanilla rules, rare or endangered animals do not have drops that can be obtained only through death. Rather, most of them, like the Komodo Dragon and Hammerhead Shark, drop their items when performing a specific function. Many of these drops and items can be used to craft unique weapons, arrows, potions, and armors with special effects. In addition, most of the mobs added are not outright hostile, but can be provoked by distance or attacking, like vanilla polar bears and piglins are. However, most of the unique, fantastical mobs are hostile.\n\nWhen joining a world with Alex's Mobs for the first time, the player will be given the **Animal Dictionary**. This is a very basic guide and documentation of each creature added by the mod, and should provide insight into uses for each of the mobs or their drops.\n\n\n If lost somehow, this book can be recrafted with a vanilla book, a green dye and any item from the mod.\n\n![Animal Dictionary](https://i.imgur.com/TEtIfTB.png)\n![Animal Dictionary 2](https://i.imgur.com/tt0ew4K.png)\n\nAlex's Mobs is intended to be used alongside other mods, including those that add new blocks, mobs, biomes and dimensions. It is **extremely configurable**, and all mob spawns can be specified by BiomeDictionary, biome registry names, dimension tags, and biome categories. This mod should play nice with biome adding mods, and should be a perfect fit for many modpacks, whether they be Vanilla-themed or extremely advanced.\n\n\nSpecial Thanks to:\n\n- Nebula240 and StickZilla (Spanish Translations)\n- Mikeliro (PT-BR Translations)\n- ChirenCQR (Chinese Translations)\n- Robongio (Swedish Translations)\n- Elloellie (German Translations)\n- BardinTheDwarf (Russian Translations)\n- Othuntgithub (Korean Translations)\n\nThank you for translating our mod!

All code is open source and documented. Some of its features include:\n\n### 📚 Read the Structure Gel API Documentation Here\n\nFor an open source working example of this api, check out [Dungeons Plus](https://modrinth.com/mod/dungeons-plus)\n\nYou can find detailed information on how to develop and use this API by Minecraft version.\n\n**Latest Documentation**\n- [1.16+](https://moddinglegacy.com/docs/structure-gel-api/1.16)\n\n**Older Documentation**\n- [1.15.2](https://moddinglegacy.com/docs/structure-gel-api/1.15)\n- [1.14.4](https://moddinglegacy.com/docs/structure-gel-api/1.14)\n\n## 🧪 Latest Features\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NWO5BqSd29E\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## 🛠️ Building Tools\n\n**The Building Tool is a new creative mode only item used to perform various large scale block alterations.**\n\n- It can be found in the Structure Items creative mode tab.\n- Right click the Building Tool in the air to open the GUI. Once open, you can select what mode you want to use, undo, redo, select your position, and more.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_gui.png\" alt=\"Building Tool GUI\">\n\n### GUI\n\nThe GUI contains various buttons to modify the Building Tool's settings, as well as some convienent tools.\n\n- Pressing, `enter`, `e`, `escape`, or clicking anywhere on the screen that isn't a button will close the GUI.\n- Hovering over any item on the GUI will display a tooltip on the right side to explain what it does and how to use it.\n- Using the radial menu, you can select which mode you want to use.\n- Some modes support positions. If they do, a button will appear on the top left to select a position based on your current location. This is mainly useful when right clicking a block isn't possible or is highly inconvenient.\n- The Undo and Redo buttons on the left exist to do exactly what they say. They attempt to undo or redo the last action you performed with the Building Tool. Up to 32 actions are saved and can be undone.\n- Some modes have additional settings, these settings will appear below the undo and redo buttons.\n- The button in the middle is used to select what block you want to use. When you click it, a text box will open for you to type a block state. This can be done in game as well, but some blocks like water are more than difficult to click on.\n\n### Controls\n\n- Middle Click: Selects the current block state you're looking at (also can be done in the GUI).\n- Left Click: This is the general key for \"do the thing\" depending on what mode you're in.\n- Right Click Air: Opens the GUI.\n- Right Click Block: Some modes use this to set positions, but ones that don't also allow this to \"do the thing\" as well.\n- Shift + Right Click: Clears the currently selected positions.\n\n### Modes\n\nBuilding Tool Modes are different operations that the Building Tool can perform.\n\n- Extend: Detects a pattern based on the side of the block you click, and attempts to place blocks in front of that to continue that pattern. If you're familiar with the old Builder's Wands mod, it's essentially the same idea.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_extend.png\" alt=\"Building Tool Extend\">\n\n- Flood: Fills all air blocks within the y level slice that you click, until it hits a border, then continues to fill going downward. This is useful for filling a lake with water for example.\n- Fill: Very similar to the vanilla fill command. Select two corners and then left click to fill the area between with the currently selected block. Has options for replacing specific blocks and only placing a frame or hollow box.\n- Line: Places a line of blocks between the selected positions using the currently selected block.\n- Clone: Copies the selected region and pastes it where you click. Allows for rotating, mirroring, and cutting instead of copying.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_clone.png\" alt=\"Building Tool Clone\">\n\n- Move: Moves the selected region in the direction that you punch.\n- Clear: Removes all blocks within the selected positions.\n- Shape: Places a shape where you click. The shape and what blocks will be replaced can be changed though the mode's properties in the GUI.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_shape.png\" alt=\"Building Tool Shape\">\n\n### Mode Properties\n\nSome modes support additional settings to modify their behavior. Some examples include:\n\n- Integrity: Determines how many blocks will actually place.\n- Replace: Determines what the mode will replace when placing blocks. All replaces everything, Air replaces only air, and Clicked replaces the block you clicked on.\n- Rotation and Mirror: Rotates or mirrors the cloned region. Allows for selecting a random value as well.\n\n## 🍡 Structure Gel Block\n\nThis block is a creative tool to fill the insides of structures easily. The gel is replaced with air when your structure generates while all air is ignored when being placed. This ensures that your structures won't have natural terrain where it shouldn't be. The gel block behaves similarly to structure voids in that you can walk through it, while actually being visible.\n\nWhen placing gel while sneaking, you can trigger the spreading mechanic. Each gel spreads differently, and you can read how they work by hovering over the item.\n\n## 🍮 Meet the Gels!\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Red Gel</summary>\n\n### Red Gel\n\nRed gel uses the default spreading mechanic, spreading along the cardinal directions, only replacing air.\n\n![Red Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/503c7a3dae8e758a1db3fa55e64d75f856576784.gif)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Blue Gel</summary>\n\n### Blue Gel\n\nBlue gel functions similarly to red, except it won't spread into locations where the sky can be seen.\n\n![Blue Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/e21b268d8e6aab180443d805f5041f1993fedbd0.gif)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Blue Gel</summary>\n\n### Green Gel\n\nGreen gel spreads the same as red gel, with the addition of also spreading diagonally. This allows it to get through corners created by vines or other complex builds. Be careful not to let it leak outside of your build.\n\n![Green Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/361a39fc615627ccdde9dbccd4f5b1ff491bb7cc.gif)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Cyan Gel</summary>\n\n### Cyan Gel\n\nCyan gel acts as a combination of green and blue gel, by both spreading diagonally and avoiding the sky.\n\n![Cyan Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/0d18b88d9a6441352e39341ebe7a69cb7e221bf3.gif)\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Orange Gel</summary>\n\n### Orange Gel\n\nOrange gel behaves the same as red gel, but the distance it spreads is determined by how many you're holding when you place it, making it handy for builds in open areas.\n\n![Orange Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/0eb11f35e96d7f27f8ccf58fa1bfecb2bd5733f8.gif)<br>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Yellow Gel</summary>\n\n### Yellow Gel\n\nYellow gel will only spread along the plane that you're facing when you place it, making it great for sealing off walls, windows, or other holes that the gel would otherwise go through.\n\n![Yellow Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/f8e014711ee125fadf49da2f3154ee95541ff1e8.gif)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Removing Gels</summary>\n\n## Removing Gels\n\nGel can be removed by using gunpowder on it. Doing this will trigger a chain reaction, removing all connected gels of the same type.\n\n![Removing Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/06352441f7bd8e0fc14d3bd8af3f5c5449aefe30.gif)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Examples</summary>\n\n## Examples\n\nHere's an example of how it could be used in a build. If this structure were loaded into the game, the gel inside would be replaced with air, while the air outside would not be placed.\n\n![house_example](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/d825a427e103a45857cc527bd3027f3736bc2eb1.gif)<br>\n\nThe code for this block is designed in a way such that you can easily extend it and hook into its behavior with methods in blocks.IStructureGel, should you need behavior not already implemented.\n\nThis is a core mod that modifies a few internal classes. If you get a crash with this mod that only occurs when mixed with another mod, this may be the cause. Please test before reporting.\n</details>\n\n\n\n\n","published":"2023-05-21T23:11:08.916649Z","updated":"2024-03-17T02:04:25.497424Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":148989,"followers":33,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":["worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["rrIuQG5f","YtlOh5ib","n7xrHFAI","hoSPdpVk","sC5VyD3U","Yj94wn7H","bsBVjIWk","bgOjiT8y","pCNl93Ka","DjvKx9sL","p2hBgWM7","Wcqj3c1P","czn0eUba","CrRybArg","WdmDpRR4","FQtCiGpd","l0hKtmBk"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/80dbc0d2d3acadcfcfc1bfa79488f0d353bac1ea.png"},"version":{"id":"rrIuQG5f","project_id":"T8TGycIQ","author_id":"87hYFRoM","featured":false,"name":"Structure Gel API v1.7.8","version_number":"1.7.8","changelog":"**Please Read**\n\nThis version is accessible on Modrinth primarily for modpack purposes.

The crash report log will now show all of the code that was running at the time of the deadlocked server. In other words, the full stacktrace of all threads instead of the normally truncated (shortened) version.\n\n \n\nIn theory, this should help with diagnosing what modded code or mixin has caused an \"off-thread\" to lock up. When a thread locks up, the server thread gets stuck and if it remains stuck for so long, the Watchdog kills it because a tick took too long to complete. **It won't help solve all deadlock issues.** But it might get you just enough info to track down the cause of a few deadlocks.\n\nImage below is an example of before and after this mod is put on **(Gallery tab shows image better)**: \n![Example of improvement](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/oZiSDGCi/images/41969c24917aacdc6741bb68413cb3b81acaa2a2.png)\n\n \n\n**Yes you may ship this mod in a modpack.** The client can also have this mod on but it won't do anything on client since the Watchdog system is only ran on servers.

So it is possible to craft a bucket out of clay.\n\nSince mod version 3.0.0.0 the library mod [BucketLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/bucketlib) is required. \n\n![asd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cech12/CeramicBucket/1.19/material/all_buckets.png \"All Buckets\")\n\nAdds 2 items to the game:\n\n- Unfired Clay Bucket: Craftable with three clay balls.\n- Ceramic Bucket: Craftable in furnace with an Unfired Clay Bucket.\n\n![asd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cech12/CeramicBucket/1.19/material/crafting.png \"Crafting\")\n\nThe Ceramic Bucket acts like a normal bucket and can contain water, lava, milk, powder snow, axolotl, tadpole and fish. All bucketable mod fluids, blocks & entities are supported. (see also [BucketLib Wiki](https://github.com/cech12/BucketLib/wiki))\n\nThe only difference is, if the bucket contains hot fluids (like lava) with a temperature of 1000 (configurable) or higher, it melts as soon as you empty it.\n\nAll Ceramic Bucket variants can be dyed like leather armor.\n\n![asd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cech12/CeramicBucket/1.19/material/coloring.png \"Ceramic Buckets with different colors\")\n\nAll mod fluids and gases are supported since mod version 2.0.0.\n\nThere is also a [wiki](https://github.com/cech12/CeramicBucket/wiki) where you can read all details about the mod.\n \n\n[![asd](https://chris-voss.de/bisect_hosting.png \"Bisect Hosting Promo Code\")](https://bisecthosting.com/cech12)\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Can I use this mod in my mod pack?\n\nYes, you are allowed to use this mod in your mod packs\n\n### Port to another Minecraft version? Which versions are supported?\n\nSorry, but I do not backport any mod to an older version. Here is a list of all supported and planned versions: [Minecraft mod versions of cech12](https://gist.github.com/cech12/662e37d2f8524037d9fef8fbe90bed5a)\n\n### Is there a Fabric version?\nA version for Fabric is not planned. But please check out this mod: Early-Game Buckets (Fabric)\n\n### Where is the config file? \nThere is a defaultconfig directory, where you can find it. If you change something there it has only an effect on new savegames. For existing savegames you need to go to the serverconfig directory of the savegame. \n\n### I found a bug or I have a good idea to enhance this mod!\nVery good!

based on the original 1.19 allay mob.\nIf you liked the older version of this mod better then please send me a message on curseforge.\n\n \n\nGet the Allay to your game.\n\nYou can find them in the Flower Forest.\n\nThey will try to search for the given items around the player in a 32 block radius.\n- Allays naturally regenerate 2♥ per second if damaged\n- they glow in dark\n- after the allay collects a stack of item it will go back to drop them off\n- they can't hold and search for items that have a max stack size of 1\n\n \n\nThe difference between this mod and the original allay in 1.19 is: \n\nThey\n- can be tempted with cookie, disc, jukebox and noteblock\n- can be dyed\n- have 2 different model to choose from and can be selected by changing the model value to 0 or 1 in the config.\n- can spawn only in biomes so if you want them to spawn in a minecraft or another mods biome\nYou have to change the biome_name line in the common config:\nFor example to:\nbiome_name = \"modid:name_of_the_biome\"\n\n\nTo let it spawn in more biomes you have to put a comma (,) between the biome names like this:\n\nbiome_name = \"modid:name_of_the_biome,minecraft:desert,minecraft:forest\"\n(You have to restart the game to let the config changes happen)\n\n \n\n(I didnt put them in cages because i dont wanted to change the world generation with structures)\n\n\n\nThe v4.0.0 is very different from the older versions so if you find any errors please let me know!\n\n \n\nThe 1.19 version doesn't have a spawn

Pretty much a must have tool for all map-makers, pack-makers and developers.\n\n🔴In-game config GUI  \n⚪️Reloadable config  \n🟢Live Stripping (No longer freezes world thread)  \n🔵More configurability  \n🟤Commands  \n🟣One-click add/remove to/from strip-list  \n🟡Block update settings (No water pouring in)  \n\n\n![Image 1](https://i.imgur.com/5ZRxh2A.jpeg)  \n![Image 2](https://i.imgur.com/7baEC5k.jpeg)\n![Image 3](https://i.imgur.com/QMxlEgn.jpeg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","published":"2022-05-21T11:34:38.363680Z","updated":"2024-03-12T19:53:36.523018Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1560,"followers":15,"categories":["utility","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.7.10","1.8.9","1.9.4","1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12.2","1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["f4jyH18U","sbE7UbxX","WTIavmPg","RKKje9hp","26WHzsFG","TLJXEmIZ","TLeLE79b","86dL3qbt","WMb588jU","Kvm7MmZb","2NjEEVq3","QZsgit9t","6NixTwrR","u5KQQJRx","eSydc3Td","4LUVZIVy","jTeBnVaH","jVuv294h","u83qgBuY","J4ohWN5B","l2tL6Tpw","JfEgUoD3"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4jjTCjk3/353baac5482767a38c3d43e41b9118afce693852.jpeg"},"version":{"id":"Kvm7MmZb","project_id":"4jjTCjk3","author_id":"koKmQ8de","featured":false,"name":"2.1.0-1.16.2-Forge","version_number":"2.1.0","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-01-10T22:38:36.859404Z","downloads":746,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"e3b1d765ab7c970c2b48f7899041dfffb0ed4b633061e50ee9341db4e5cfe13744ceae8f87f334cba0679e23ea4e74de9be5ff401eef70e38ebe27012903bbf2","sha1":"47b4288688d2afe46ac211b64c8adf6d9c0f3961"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4jjTCjk3/versions/Kvm7MmZb/World%2BStripper-1.16.5-2.1.0.jar","filename":"World+Stripper-1.16.5-2.1.0.jar","primary":true,"size":139989,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"zYkSETDo","user":{"id":"koKmQ8de","username":"Ewy","name":"Eivind Norling","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/koKmQ8de/icon.jpeg","bio":"Modded Minecraft for over 10 years 🥳","created":"2021-12-02T19:52:16.252500Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"World Stripper-1.16.5-2.1.0.jar"},"mods\\snowballsfreezemobs_1.16.5-1.4.jar":{"sha512":"b9017e0a9cc007ac68e59cc0aaaec7355b82aef44103c03ea30b75a560b628c74d0a603e989969c6849024606029f9557a8f6f2580246d521cd3fc3fe61bec9b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ETKe9DNz","slug":"snowballs-freeze-mobs","project_type":"mod","team":"ML4zpJKL","title":"Snowballs Freeze Mobs","description":"☃️ Hitting mobs with a snowball will freeze them for a configurable amount of time.","body":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><center><a href=\"https://serilum.com/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/description/header/header.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"838\" height=\"400\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://curseforge.com/members/serilum/projects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/curseforge.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/user/Serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/modrinth.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://patreon.com/serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/patreon.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://youtube.com/@serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/youtube.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a></center></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Requires the library mod&nbsp;<a style=\"font-size:24px\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/collective\" rel=\"nofollow\">Collective</a>.</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;<br><br> &nbsp;

Developed by teampotato, this mod incorporates a single mixin to seamlessly integrate its features into the game.\n\n## Description\nThe Arrow Collector mod focuses on a specific aspect of the game: arrows and their retrieval. With this mod installed, you'll witness a new level of convenience when it comes to collecting arrows fired from your bow. No longer will you need to worry about losing valuable ammunition during intense battles or long-range encounters.\n\n## Functionality\nThe core functionality of the Arrow Collector mod lies in its ability to modify the behavior of arrows upon release from a bow. By leveraging the power of mixins, the mod intercepts the default arrow release mechanism and introduces a smart feature.\n\nWhen using a bow without the Infinity enchantment, the mod ensures that any arrows fired will be retrievable. Normally, arrows shot from a non-enchanted bow have a chance of being destroyed upon impact or simply disappearing. However, the Arrow Collector mod takes care of this issue by granting the arrows a special status: they become \"pickup-allowed\" entities.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that when you shoot an arrow using a regular bow, you can rest assured that it will remain intact and ready to be picked up after landing. You no longer need to worry about losing arrows in inaccessible areas or during hectic combat situations. With the Arrow Collector mod, you'll have the chance to retrieve your ammunition and reuse it as needed.\n## Conclusion\nThe Arrow Collector mod brings a small yet impactful enhancement to the Minecraft archery experience. By guaranteeing the retrieval of arrows fired from non-enchanted bows, this mod provides a sense of convenience and conservation. Say goodbye to wasted arrows and embrace a more resourceful approach to combat and exploration. Download the Arrow Collector mod today and ensure that no arrow goes to waste in your Minecraft adventures!","published":"2023-12-15T15:55:44.955595Z","updated":"2023-12-15T16:02:56.461243Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":651,"followers":7,"categories":["adventure","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["TCNNyCDX","FEvGl5hr","zet655sj","CCpDpUQX"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ez00YFnH/d4cd3cf834b39ce22bd483354acd105a8490c5fe.png"},"version":{"id":"FEvGl5hr","project_id":"ez00YFnH","author_id":"yoApeVOc","featured":false,"name":"1.16.5-0.0.2","version_number":"1.16.5-0.0.2","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-15T16:00:27.971364Z","downloads":97,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"01cca665ad85bffdf6476bd624f4b33aa7761f33","sha512":"5ecb957b504abbfb8472ad68129c897bdc63efae4ad99ecddd6d66c820f2f98f7a36defebe70e76b2dd312a5d2f375af8ab7b9ba1800d10b47132a44725879b9"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ez00YFnH/versions/FEvGl5hr/arrowcollector-1.16.5-0.0.2.jar","filename":"arrowcollector-1.16.5-0.0.2.jar","primary":true,"size":3936,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"5Yp7KhCy","user":{"id":"yoApeVOc","username":"Kasualix","name":"Catastrophe Chou","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110756250?v=4","bio":"\nمكتوب\n","created":"2022-08-15T11:08:18.078827Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"arrowcollector-1.16.5-0.0.2.jar"},"mods\\tinker_rapier-1.1.4-1.16.5.jar":{"sha512":"fa3c44f1c161a6e046b37bb558e56b5d2dc101beba8d72ba7b5b0d734981607746d8546155b1244459c8790c842393184fdea68e4f7a99c91e32552bb54d8672","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Tinkers' Rapier","description":"We brought back the Rapier to TiC 3!\n","authors":["MCMOD Modding Group"],"version":"${file.jarVersion}","icon":null,"project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"tinker_rapier-1.1.4-1.16.5.jar"},"mods\\pamhc2crops-1.16.3-1.0.2.jar":{"sha512":"ca8eca7a975b999cd5bfd5beb4f36143c965f6fb5211a31277b037c5cef222344e48629262a83ee4c8f9d63e68815b8abbadb3580287152689325148e8778f2a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Pam's HarvestCraft 2 Crops","description":"Pam's HarvestCraft 2 Crops adds all new crops to the game\n","authors":[],"version":"${version}","icon":null,"project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"pamhc2crops-1.16.3-1.0.2.jar"},"mods\\AttributeFix-1.16.5-10.1.4.jar":{"sha512":"cbb96d2257f24bd24111825728701247b18359b0eaff7dee1ef1170311eb4920b13e3da7f46b5154d626df101a0adb4922d728beb656638f0cd38fe2ba081283","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"lOOpEntO","slug":"attributefix","project_type":"mod","team":"D9VMVOio","title":"AttributeFix","description":"Removes arbitrary limits on Minecraft's attribute system.

They're prepared to fight any threat to the village (possibly including you!). To make new guards, crouch + right click on a nitwit or unemployed villager with a sword or crossbow.\n\nGuards can 'gossip' with villagers and will trust the player to open their inventory if they have a high enough reputation, have hero of the village, or is created by the player. Right clicking will open up the guard inventory, allowing you to give them armor, and swap out their weapons! For their offhand slot, you can either give them a shield, or some food. If they have a shield, they will use it to block attacks. Crossbow guards with a shield won't be able to kick enemies if they're blocking. If they have food (or a potion), they will start eating or drinking if they are low on health. Clicking the patrol button will allow you to set patrol points for guards, melee guards will walk around the point while ranged guards will snipe enemies and stand still on their point.\n\nIf you have hero of the village, they will gain the ability to follow and fight for you when you click the follow button.\n![Guard](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/H1sntfo8/images/0b0df1486eb77f265e6aef5b619288a83b548bb0.png)\n\n\n\n \n\n# AI Changes\nWitches attack villagers. *true by default \n\n\n\nIn raids, illagers kill any animal they see. *false by default \n\nVillagers and Illagers are scared of polar bears. *true by default \n\nClerics heal low-health guards, villagers, and players with Hero of the Village using regeneration potions, and smiths repair iron golems with ingots.\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\nCan you port to an older version/fabric?\n\nNo. Maintaining one version is hard enough already, and I've never learned fabric. However, the mod's license permits you to make ports yourself. A fabric version of this mod also currently exists.\n\nCan you port to Windows 10 Edition/Xbox/Mobile?\n\nNo. Mods for the Bedrock ediiton use a completely different framework that I've also never learned. The mod's license allows you to try yourself, but since the modding API on Bedrock is less capable than forge you probably won't be able to replicate all of it.\n\nWhy don't guards have a workstation like other villager professions?\n\nI haven't thought of a suitable block that would let you have a large number of guards without being inconvenient to store.\n\nHow would you make guards spawn with modded equipment?\n\nYou can make them spawn with modded equipment by making a datapack that overrides the guard_chestplate, guard_helmet, guard_legs, guard feet, guard_main_hand or guard_off_hand json files. \n\nIs this mod compatible with X?\n\nTry and see!\n\n \n\n Special thanks to those in the MMD discord for helping me with some of the mods contents.","published":"2022-09-03T23:22:15.287365Z","updated":"2024-03-03T20:19:32.784586Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":72694,"followers":135,"categories":["mobs","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["pBMhXHpy","FDyptF3C","h74EaSxg","tgvSxMbz","m5FPm7qd","VKAaGaUt","8FhU0wlh","CuWQRWRh","ZkNhijwC","d6rBM4Cg","FJBvRpmS","cwxNfyOe","F2iGn9UV","a6unnpep","V3WwPGO0","e2O5TKqU","APAV3nRX","HaGxOuRA","MUAGK1gz","wXjGQwVf","bhwMZR6g","ZXYzy1iR","7XuY8OQc","dYJvXrpF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/H1sntfo8/de6a0dca1d4d1f1e1c97409b51683cc7348797a6.png"},"version":{"id":"7XuY8OQc","project_id":"H1sntfo8","author_id":"9vwtx5vp","featured":false,"name":"Guard Villagers 1.2.6","version_number":"1.2.6","changelog":"- 1.16.5","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-03T20:19:15.751605Z","downloads":464,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"7787f5bb89015d5790ad7f9a163481bd6672efd6","sha512":"1267557f4ef054663d9cf8a58da387a30b0167f812056db5297593144dfc7356e92a92686561aee39f2eaf272501557b750907270c7501e1660ab15b6f655e33"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/H1sntfo8/versions/7XuY8OQc/guardvillagers-1.16.5.1.2.6.jar","filename":"guardvillagers-1.16.5.1.2.6.jar","primary":true,"size":190249,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"DgYRJUTF","user":{"id":"9vwtx5vp","username":"seymourimadeit","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55965249?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-29T05:53:33.697802Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"guardvillagers-1.16.5.1.2.6.jar"},"mods\\Mantle-1.16.5-1.6.157.jar":{"sha512":"56f58179242e40a11ab993f41e830feb983162836bb04d4c15e507c5f056f00732e09a033a072f84703f856b6e1994c38bc40db13a9f90b30dd5dc4850b259b1","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Cg6Uc79H","slug":"mantle","project_type":"mod","team":"Us377YGS","title":"Mantle","description":"Base library required for SlimeKnights mods, including Tinkers' Construct, Natura, Inspirations, and Cermaics","body":"\n![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SlimeKnights/Mantle/master/src/main/resources/Mantle.png)\n\nThis contains shared code for Forge mods and is used by the SlimeKnights such as Tinkers' Construct, Natura, Tinkers' Mechworks, Inspirations, and Ceramics.

Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily.

This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not.

The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2024-03-24T17:39:00.454764Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3828461,"followers":4441,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.7.10","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.12.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV","2I1m95aJ","M5k1QJL1","knltv3Vh","iC2A1KnJ","McVB9vXT","7JR5qJ8f"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"AXYavMt5","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":false,"name":"1.5.2 - Forge 1.16.x","version_number":"1.5.2-forge-1.16","changelog":"Fixed an issue with the position calculation in 1.16.

**currently no documentation** for it, so it would probably be a very annoying experience.\n\n\n## Bug Reports and Requests\n\nYou can report bugs and request features

mod for dumping game registries, dumping the data for the held or looked at block/entity/item, counting blocks, biomes, entities, block entities from the world etc.","body":"## Description\n\nTellMe is an informational mod for Minecraft. It is primarily meant for mod pack makers, mod developers or other users who need some technical information about the game, such as various game registry dumps.\nIt has various commands for dumping registries, for listing loaded entities/block entities/chunks/dimensions, for counting blocks or biomes in a given area etc.\n\n**Note:** All the dump files go in the `.minecraft/config/tellme/` directory and have the current timestamp in the filename.\n\nTip about the dump command: you can use the type `all` to run all the dump types at once, without having to type each one in manually.\n\n![Commands](https://i.imgur.com/FWPzK4v.png \"Commands\")\n\n## Available commands\n\nIn the 1.14.4 and later versions, the available \"top level\" commands are:\n\n* `batch-run` - runs commands from text files inside the `config/tellme/batch_commands/` directory\n* `biome` - prints a bunch of information of the current biome to chat\n* `biome-locate` - samples biomes on a grid and outputs the closest location of each unique biome\n* `biome-stats` - counts the biomes in a given area\n* `block-stats` - counts the blocks in a given area\n* `dump` - can dump all the game registries and a few other types of information\n* `dump-json` - a specialized version of dump, only for blocks and items, to output the data in JSON format\n* `holding` - prints information and the NBT data (if any) from the item in the player's hand\n* `loaded` - list loaded chunks, dimensions, entities or tile entities in a given area or in all loaded chunks\n* `locate` - searches for blocks, entities or tile entities by name from a given area or all loaded chunks\n* `locate-biome` - searches for biomes in a given radius by sampling at a given grid interval\n* `looking-at` - prints some basic information and the NBT data from the block (and tile entity) or entity the player is looking at\n\n## Command arguments/usage\n\nIn the 1.14 and later versions, I would recommend just using the command suggestions and completions to see the usage of each command.\nFor this to work, you should have the mod on both sides. If the mod is on the server side, it's not required on the clients, but the command suggestions for most arguments won't work without the mod on the client.\n\n## \"Sidedness\"\n\nCurrently in 1.14.4+ the mod only works when it's present on the logical server side, so either in single player, or when the mod is on the dedicated server. In other words there are no client-side commands anymore (for now at least) like there were in 1.12.2. (But of course using the client-side commands on a server wouldn't work properly for most things that list or locate something from the world anyway.) In addition to this, the mod should be on the clients that want to use the commands for the command suggestions/completions to work (like mentioned above).\n","published":"2023-04-17T20:11:11.367297Z","updated":"2024-01-13T22:54:22.405157Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":1986,"followers":17,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.7.10","1.8","1.8.1","1.8.2","1.8.3","1.8.4","1.8.5","1.8.6","1.8.7","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.9","1.9.4","1.10","1.10.1","1.10.2","1.11","1.11.1","1.11.2","1.12","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","liteloader"],"versions":["YAbO77WB","75gP97VR","ZHELrGUl","V4vSjV7s","Gh5Mgdh4","endtZKc7","WeqwbAU8","j6LzW8lT","2byXvHFi","zN72Oi6u","Xz0Kwb81","yurtgVY3","tcsLd9Z8","5BfSY6Nz","fgkRcQc2","m7tzAwNB","u5QClTGY","vDlLDzSk","CVl4ZS3w","Toz3fbii","pUDJ1DxP","WDhdep5O","tSpFQxJs","CIXGXpX4","9W5fphzK","C25hBCYY","t69yCS0l","hiIoWFzJ","mXy9RXLP","n7pYBeWj","G3wf1CkY","kAhd7Q81","fneIoZDO","iRpamoks","f93KOyfm","cRJL7f2O","cMmCgxzl","dTk48KDf","xIRtzzMM","QVu3ZHPs","8qDZUjkJ","H2kJO6Z0","sBYKZCI9","l0l54yZE","I6LffwsE","os6yP8Xi","WCxbOL6z","WwQyqgmM","Bw9EqHwA","aU7RdZEE","UsUIUzOw","eWgaFFpF","UDuIQu9q","TVdh19db","PpClL2Pu","7wvItkzv","FiETAneN","TzpFVyDx","lskFFnQb","5f05MwL7","GkgpHuAc","Nycvwit9","ceneNP0l","pQVPUL0t","Z0RVfAnW","gIfenVD4","LoHReUxf","nyUcNHV3","WjWAomQ1","8zMlaPpQ","rfmeKuSa","HK0OVla2","s4CJu387","ZLh6sP4W","UpkkNjFM","eCBF47qw","IguBWoLU","L1JtysAT","kvcqHQ5h","UVDoAnA8","dJTwPaHG","HtNb4Qhf","SRkO8q02","QE9x2L23","eJhPuF2n","1ixijDwj","ksLhU2Ww","ruthrCPf","Hp76wpaQ","YBuhxX7h","OUV5f4OV","nKSiOYrC","oxMy5sXi","2SPIaP5Q","eh0eXAG0","yuL9TPvy","mLr0TISk","qr8rnqhr","MaTp4krL","EtYbJv9D","xKZS9xC1","6GKF7Cun","6s2bysgn","JW6RmjDB","SXR5La9G","NcfuKEtu","aIbOb22P","hm8JFu3z"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ytk7UEym/ad453cd147b16ee3ce0a1882c8ff9c7310c2a4e8.png"},"version":{"id":"ruthrCPf","project_id":"ytk7UEym","author_id":"yduuH4WA","featured":false,"name":"0.9.1","version_number":"0.9.1","changelog":"*

The tools never disappear and can be named and changed to your heart's desire. Once you make them, they're yours forever. Many different materials can be used to make your tools.\n\nThis mod includes many related features, including:\n* Part builders, tinker stations, and modifier workstations for building and modifying your tools\n* The melter, alloyer, smeltery, and foundry for working with molten metals\n* Slime islands generating as part of the overworld, nether, and end, granting access to 5 different slime colors\n* Slimy geodes spawning deep underground\n* Cobalt ore in the nether\n\nTo get started, craft Materials and You then follow the introduction steps. We will work on getting a better description here on Modrinth in the future - did not want to copy an outdated description from CurseForge.\n\n\n## Credits\n\n### Tinkers' Construct 3\n\n* KnightMiner - Lead Developer\n* alexbegt - Developer\n* boni - former developer\n* mDiyo - Original author, game design input\n* RCXcrafter - Artist\n* See contributors on GitHub for a full list of contributors\n\n### Tinkers' Construct 2\n\n* boni - Lead Developer\n* KnightMiner - Developer\n* alexbegt - Developer/Updating\n* mDiyo - Original Author of the mod\n* Firedingo - General Task Support\n* Drullkus - Villager textures\n* Anbaric - Pattern chest and part chest model\n \n### Tinkers' Construct 1\n\n* mDiyo - Lead Developer\n* boni - Developer\n* fuj1n - Landmines, Former Developer\n* progwml6 - Former Developer\n* Fudgy_Fetus - Cutlasses\n* NekoGloop - Thaumium Textures\n* Skyboy - New tool renderer\n* Zerokyuuni - Battlegear support\n* Vexatos - Translations\n* BluSunrize - Casting Channels\n* tonius11 - NEI Support\n* baddaspig - Slime Crystal graphics","published":"2022-12-28T01:42:54.536335Z","updated":"2024-03-01T08:07:26.254767Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":166157,"followers":290,"categories":["equipment","magic","technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.6.4","1.7.10","1.12.2","1.16.5","1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["HXIzidIf","3KJI35bq","mNZUIBbe","qTJGiuCo","ADIRkxKS","jUnitpGk","3XnE2iWA","5x4nQV0E","TkJ6nDUK","rtqDbRrV","5s1u9uN2","4U8Td4Sc"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rxIIYO6c/7a24bafaf8a7ce40cea07a4a070e6dd78a86ebd6.png"},"version":{"id":"3KJI35bq","project_id":"rxIIYO6c","author_id":"M8sIi0fq","featured":false,"name":"3.3.4.335","version_number":"3.3.4.335","changelog":"Final 1.16.5 release on CurseForge, originally uploaded on March 16, 2022.\n\nFor more info see https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct/releases","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-12-28T06:19:26.264614Z","downloads":100000,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"bfccf8cb255bc64101c0ae27cac7f3b386b88078","sha512":"e5687d747d5aad9e8f047608702130322a70603457aae2c2bed29f1422bc8650f7cc38e48a76e552f387194a91dedd59d8f3e2dcfa98083920e608716ef62add"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rxIIYO6c/versions/3KJI35bq/TConstruct-1.16.5-3.3.4.335.jar","filename":"TConstruct-1.16.5-3.3.4.335.jar","primary":true,"size":10927812,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Cg6Uc79H","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.16.5"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"cwCajnNu","user":{"id":"N8YcFMTR","username":"alexbegt","name":"Alexander (alexbegt)","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1350590?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-12-28T01:50:01.943543Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"cwCajnNu","user":{"id":"Lo9AmRuG","username":"mDiyo","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430358?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-12-28T02:16:56.436092Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"cwCajnNu","user":{"id":"M8sIi0fq","username":"KnightMiner","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12155288?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-12-28T01:40:50.398752Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"TConstruct-1.16.5-3.3.4.335.jar"}},"modrinth_update_version":"iZbTAPbN"}
