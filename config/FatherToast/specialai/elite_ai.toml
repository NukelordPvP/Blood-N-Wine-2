# specialai:elite_ai.toml
# This config contains options for elite AI patterns. Elite AI patterns bestow stat boosts, specific
# equipment, and allow these 'elite' mobs to perform actions in combat that can pose a great threat.
# See the appendix at the bottom of this file for more information on the elite AI patterns available.
# In general; changing options for elite AIs granted, attributes, and equipment only affects new entities.
# All other option changes affect existing entities (even in a running client) unless otherwise stated.

	# Entity List fields: General format = [ "namespace:entity_type value1 value2 ...", ... ]
	#   Entity lists are arrays of entity types. Some entity lists specify a number of values linked to each entity type.
	#   Entity types are defined by their key in the entity registry, usually following the pattern 'namespace:entity_name'.
	#   'default' can be used instead of an entity type registry key to provide default values for all entities.
	#   An asterisk '*' can be used to match multiple entity types. For example, 'minecraft:*' will match all vanilla entities.
	#   List entries by default match any entity type derived from (i.e. based on) their entity type. For example, '~minecraft:zombie'.
	#     There is no steadfast rule about extending, even in vanilla, but the hope is that mod-added mobs will extend their base mob.


# Category: general
# Options for customizing the elite AI system and options that affect all elite AI patterns.

	# List of mobs that can gain elite AI patterns and their chances to gain those patterns.
	# Additional values after the entity type are the chances (0.0 to 1.0) for entities of that type to spawn with elite AI.
	# You can specify multiple chances for each entity - each chance will be rolled and multiple AIs can stack.
