# specialai:general.toml
# This config contains options for several miscellaneous features in the mod, such as:
# animals, reactions, jockeys, and door breaking.

	# Entity List fields: General format = [ "namespace:entity_type value1 value2 ...", ... ]
	#   Entity lists are arrays of entity types. Some entity lists specify a number of values linked to each entity type.
	#   Entity types are defined by their key in the entity registry, usually following the pattern 'namespace:entity_name'.
	#   'default' can be used instead of an entity type registry key to provide default values for all entities.
	#   An asterisk '*' can be used to match multiple entity types. For example, 'minecraft:*' will match all vanilla entities.
	#   List entries by default match any entity type derived from (i.e. based on) their entity type. For example, '~minecraft:zombie'.
	#     There is no steadfast rule about extending, even in vanilla, but the hope is that mod-added mobs will extend their base mob.

	# Block List fields: General format = [ "namespace:block_name[property1=value1,...]", ... ]
	#   Block lists are arrays of blocks and partial block states.
	#   Blocks are defined by their key in the block registry, usually following the pattern 'namespace:block_name'.
	#   An asterisk '*' can be used to match multiple blocks. For example, 'minecraft:*' will match all vanilla blocks.
	#   List entries by default match any block state. The block states to match can be narrowed down by specifying properties.
	#     The syntax for block state properties is the same as for commands. Any properties not specified will match any value.
	#     For example, 'minecraft:beehive[honey_level=5]' will match any full beehives, regardless of the direction they face.
