# specialmobs:_family_of_spiders.toml
# This config contains options that apply to the family of spiders as a whole;
# that is, the vanilla replacement and all special variants.


# Category: general
# Options standard to all mob families (that is, not specific to any particular mob family).

	# Whether this mob family replaces vanilla spiders with its vanilla replacement species.

	# When greater than 0, spiders will have a random render scale applied. This is a visual effect only.
	# If this is set to a non-negative value, it overrides the value set for "master_random_scaling", though
	# species configs can override this value.
