# Options standard to all mob species (that is, not specific to any particular mob species).

	# The chance for frozen drowned to succeed at natural spawn attempts. Does not affect Mob Replacement.
	# Note: Most species do NOT naturally spawn - they must be added by a mod or data pack for this option to do anything.
